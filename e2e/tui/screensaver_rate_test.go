// TestScreensaverPaintsAtSixtyAtMost is the saver's frame rate, read off the

//
// tuiffects writes its effects for sixty frames a second, and most of them
// count frames. The saver used to tick at the session's NormalFPS, so with
// max_fps = 240 it ran those effects four times too fast at four times the
// CPU. It now paints at sixty at most, and its virtual clock steps at the same
// rate, so an effect that reads the clock keeps its length too.
//
//   - middleout counts frames: 99 of them, 1.65 s at sixty. At max_fps = 240 it
//     must still take at least 1.2 s.
//   - The same effect at max_fps = 30 must take at least 2.6 s (3.3 s at thirty
//     frames a second). This is the positive half: it fails if max_fps never
//     reaches the saver, which would let the first case pass for no reason.
//   - tuffbaby paces its clip by the clock. At max_fps = 240 it must finish
//     within 1.8 times its time at max_fps = 60, which fails when the tick and
//     the clock disagree. The bound is a ratio to a run on the same machine,
//     so a busy machine slows both runs and does not fail the test. At 60 the
//     cap changes nothing, so that run is the same with or without the fix.
//
// Measured on 2026-10-08 at 100x30 and a load average near 30. middleout at
// 240: 0.47 s on main and 1.63 s with the cap. tuffbaby at 240: 9.60 s with the
// cap, and 26.72 s with the cap on the tick but the clock still built from
// NormalFPS. See NEGATIVE_CONTROLS.md.
