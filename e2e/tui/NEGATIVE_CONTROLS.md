# Negative controls for the end-to-end suite

A regression test that has never been observed to fail on broken code is not
evidence. Every test in this package that claims to cover a specific bug was run
against a binary built with that bug's fix removed, and the result is recorded
below. Two of them are **not** caught here; that is written down rather than
papered over, because a suite whose real coverage is unknown is worse than no
suite.

## Two rules for every control

Three green suites hid three real defects in one week. All three had a negative
control, and all three controls passed. These two rules are what the misses have
in common. They apply to every test in the project, not only this suite.

### 1. A negative test needs its positive half

A test that asserts "X does not happen when Y" must also assert, in the same
fixture, "X happens when not Y".

Without the positive half, the negative half may never have tested Y at all. A
gate written `if A && B && C` is only a test of `C` while `A` and `B` are true.
One privacy gate was asserted by a fixture that failed an earlier term, so the
test read the right answer off the wrong reason, and the gate could be deleted
with three packages still green.

The positive half costs one more row in the table. If it fails, the negative
half was never testing what its name says.

### 2. The control deletes the call site, not the function

When a pull request adds a feature, cut its wiring: the `case`, the `Register`,
the route, the gate line. Do not cut the function under it.

A control on the function proves the test and the function are bound to each
other. It says nothing about whether anything calls the function. One feature
registered 18 actions that no key reached. Its eight controls all passed,
because all eight cut the handler and the fault was the switch above it.

Cut the wiring, run the named test, and watch it fail. If it does not fail, the
test enters the code below the fault, and the fault is what nobody is testing.

## Paste buffers (#514)

`paste_buffers_test.go`, `paste_buffers_scope_test.go`,
`paste_buffers_config_test.go`, `paste_buffers_bytes_test.go` and
`paste_buffers_rules_test.go` have seventeen tests and twenty-six controls.
Four unit tests in `internal/session/verb_buffers_test.go` and
`verb_lines_test.go` bound the daemon's memory and keep the person's share of
it, a security boundary, with eight controls of their own. On 2026-10-08 each control below cut one piece of
wiring, built a binary, and ran the named test against it. Every control
failed where shown, and the same tests passed on the branch build.

| Control: what was cut | Test | Where it failed |
| --- | --- | --- |
| The `SaveToPasteBuffers` call in `copyModeEffects.apply` | `TestPasteBuffersKeepYanksAndPasteThem` | after two yanks the daemon holds 0 buffers |
| `d.Register("paste_buffer", ...)` | `TestPasteBuffersKeepYanksAndPasteThem` | prefix `]` shows no "Pasted" |
| `d.Register("choose_buffer", ...)` | `TestPasteBuffersKeepYanksAndPasteThem` | prefix `#` never lists the buffers |
| The bracketed wrap in `verbPasteBuffer` | `TestPasteBuffersKeepYanksAndPasteThem` | no marks with bracketed paste on, after the paste with it off passed |
| `daemonBuffers` in the tmux shim always false | `TestPasteBuffersKeepYanksAndPasteThem` | `tmux show-buffer` does not see the CLI's buffer |
| The `readsBuffers` read-grant check in `checkGrants` | `TestPasteBufferVerbsFollowPaneGrants` | the pane with no grants reads its buffer, and `NONE_SHOW=1` never prints |
| The `GrantWrite` check for `set-buffer` in `checkGrants` | `TestPasteBufferVerbsFollowPaneGrants` | the pane with read alone sets a buffer, and `READ_SET=1` never prints |
| `d.buffers.SetLimits` in `applyUserConfig` | `TestPasteBufferLimitFollowsTheConfig` | after `limit = 1` two buffers stay, with limit 2 |
| The local store's `Add` in `saveLocalBuffer` | `TestPasteBuffersWithoutADaemon` | prefix `]` shows no "Pasted" |
| The owner filter in `paneBuffers` | `TestAPaneSeesOnlyItsOwnBuffers` | the pane reads the person's buffer, and `OTHER_SHOW=1` never prints |
| `list-buffers` sums every buffer for `bytes` | `TestAPaneSeesOnlyItsOwnBuffers` | the pane's listing says 5020 bytes, want its own 8 |
| `bare` gives the person every buffer | `TestThePersonsNewestIsNeverAPanes` | the person's bare `show-buffer` prints the agent's `planted` |
| The chooser's tag uncut and drawn whatever its length | `TestThePersonsNewestIsNeverAPanes` | the agent's long pane name fills the row, and `planted` and `7 bytes` are gone from it |
| The byte test in the store's `trim` | `TestPasteBufferByteCap` | both 600-byte buffers stay under `max_kb = 1` |
| `[paste_buffers]` left out of `DefaultConfig` | `TestPasteBufferKeysLiveInTheirFile` | `config prune --dry-run` does not list `paste_buffers.max_kb` |
| The shim sends a buffer as text in `data`, not `data_b64` | `TestPasteBufferKeepsEveryByte` | the binary file comes back with U+FFFD from byte 128, 520 bytes for 260 |
| The shim sends the parts of an upload as text | `TestPasteBufferKeepsEveryByte` | the 1.8 MB file differs at byte 786430, where the first cut splits a character |
| `SanitizePaste` in `verbPasteBuffer` | `TestPasteBufferSendsNoEscapeSequences` | `^[[201~evil` reaches the pane inside the paste |
| `BufferChooserActivate` pastes into the focused pane, not the one the chooser opened on | `TestPasteBufferChooserPastesWhereItOpened` | the paste lands in the pane that took the focus later |
| The local save in `handlePasteBufferSaveFailed` | `TestPasteBuffersWithAnOldDaemon` | with a daemon that answers `unknown_verb`, prefix `]` shows no "Pasted" |
| The change filter that `verbSetBuffer` passes to `Set` | `TestAPaneCannotReplaceThePersonsNamedBuffer` | the agent's `set-buffer -b release` exits 0, and `SHADOW=1` never prints |
| `find` takes the newest buffer of any kind for no name | `TestPasteBufferNamesFollowTmux` | `show-buffer` prints `named-x`, not `auto-y` |
| `trim` counts every buffer against the limit | `TestPasteBufferNamesFollowTmux` | under `limit = 2` the named buffer goes at the third buffer, so the `-a` check finds two |
| `set-buffer -a` with no name appends to the newest buffer | `TestPasteBufferNamesFollowTmux` | `-a extra` lands in `named-x`, and no new buffer appears |
| `PasteText` keeps every line feed | `TestPasteBufferTurnsLineFeedsIntoReturns` | `cat -v` shows no `LFa^MLFbLFa` |
| The version cut from `pasteBufferNamed` | `TestPasteBufferChooserSkipsAChangedBuffer` | Enter pastes the new text, and "changed after the list" never shows |
| The total check in `uploadPart` | `TestBufferUploadsHoldBoundedMemory` (unit) | two connections hold 1800 bytes under a cap of 1000 |
| One upload per connection in `uploadPart` | `TestBufferUploadsHoldBoundedMemory` (unit) | after a second id the connection holds 902 bytes, want 2 |
| `defer d.dropUploads(cs)` in `handleJSONConnection` | `TestAClosedConnectionDropsItsUpload` (unit) | the daemon still holds 4096 bytes 5 seconds after the connection closed |
| The `maxVerbLine` check in `verbLineReader.next` | `TestVerbLinesHoldBoundedMemory` (unit) | a line of 12582913 bytes is read whole |
| The budget refusal in `verbLineReader.next` | `TestVerbLinesHoldBoundedMemory` (unit) | a 200 KiB line is read with the budget taken |
| The budget release in `verbLineReader.done` | `TestVerbLinesHoldBoundedMemory` (unit) | after a refusal the budget still holds 573 chunks |
| Every line charged to the panes' budget | `TestThePersonsShareSurvivesAFullPanePool` (unit) | with the panes' budget full, the person's 1 MB upload part is refused and the connection closed |
| The upload total counted across the person and the panes | `TestThePersonsShareSurvivesAFullPanePool` (unit) | with the panes' uploads full, the person's part is refused as "too many uploads" |

The tests carry their positive halves. Each refused grant is served once the
grant is given. A pane that may not reach the person's buffer still reaches
its own, and reaches every buffer once it holds `admin`. The agent that may
not set the person's name still makes a buffer with no name. A buffer an admin
pane sets with no name is the person's newest. The bracketed check pastes once
with bracketed paste off, where no marks may show, before the paste where they
must.

```sh
TUIOS_E2E=1 TUIOS_E2E_BIN=/path/to/tuios TUIOS_E2E_FRAMES=/path/to/frames go test \
  -run 'TestPasteBuffer|TestPasteKey|TestAPane.*Buffer|TestThePersons' -count=1 -timeout 5m .
```

With `TUIOS_E2E_FRAMES` set, the run writes `paste-buffers-chooser`,
`paste-buffers-pasted`, `paste-buffers-bracketed`, `paste-buffers-grants`,
`paste-buffers-own-only`, `paste-buffers-planted`, `paste-buffers-escapes`,
`paste-buffers-no-takeover` and `paste-buffers-line-feeds`.

`TestPasteBuffersWithAnOldDaemon` sets `TUIOS_E2E_NO_BUFFER_VERBS=1`. With
`TUIOS_E2E=1` as well, the daemon answers every buffer verb with
`unknown_verb`, as a daemon from before them does. Nothing else reads it.

## OpenCode V2 plugin loading and session isolation

`TestOpenCodeV2PluginReportsOnlyItsSession` installs the shipped plugin, loads
its server and CLI entrypoints under a V2 API driver, and reports through a real
tuios daemon. It records `opencode-v2-session-isolation` state and frame artifacts.
It covers busy/done/error, permission and form prompts, and other-session and
subagent events while the main pane is working.

On 2026-10-06, before adding the V2 entrypoints, the test failed at plugin load:
`OpenCode V2 requires a default plugin definition` (`undefined` instead of
`string`). The same command passed with the fix:

```sh
TUIOS_E2E=1 TUIOS_E2E_BIN=/path/to/tuios TUIOS_E2E_FRAMES=/path/to/artifacts go test \
  -run TestOpenCodeV2PluginReportsOnlyItsSession -count=1 -timeout 3m .
```

The original failure was also observed in the real OpenCode 2.0.23 server log:
`Plugin must export a default definition with an id and an effect or setup function`
(`Missing key ["default"]`). A separate real-client check with OpenCode 2.0.23,
an isolated shared service and a PTY client confirmed automatic CLI plugin
discovery and form create/cancel reporting, while another session's form was
ignored. The driver test does not claim to execute OpenCode itself.

## How to rebuild a control

The controls are built by removing one fix from the current tree, so they differ
from the shipping binary only in that fix. Checking out the pre-fix ancestor
instead would drag in unrelated differences and prove less.

```sh
git clone --shared . /tmp/negctl && cd /tmp/negctl
git checkout -f <base>          # the commit the suite was written against

# then either revert the fix hunk:
git show <fix-sha> -- <file> | git apply -R -
# or inject the fault by hand, when later commits have moved the code

go build -o /tmp/tuios-broken ./cmd/tuios
```

Run the suite against it from `e2e/tui`:

```sh
TUIOS_E2E=1 TUIOS_E2E_BIN=/tmp/tuios-broken go test -count=1 -timeout 550s .
```

`-count=1` is mandatory. Go's test cache will happily replay a previous PASS
across a change of `TUIOS_E2E_BIN`, which during the writing of this suite made
a working negative control look like a broken one for half an hour.

## Results

| Bug | Fix removed | How | Tests that fail | Verdict |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| File search cannot open from a terminal pane through the leader shortcut | whole change | build main before the file search change and point `TUIOS_E2E_BIN` at it | `TestSidebarFileSearch/standalone` and `/daemon` (both time out waiting for `Search files`) | **caught** (2 of 2 run) |

| Mouse: the wheel announced a mode, stranded the user in it, and a drag moved the window instead of selecting | whole change | build the merge-base (`2005b01`) and point `TUIOS_E2E_BIN` at it | `TestWheelScrollShowsScrollbackWithoutAnnouncingAMode`, `TestWheelDownToBottomReturnsToLiveOutput`, `TestTypingWhileScrolledSnapsBackToLiveOutput`, `TestDragSelectionCopiesOnRelease`, `TestDoubleClickCopiesAWordAndTripleClickTheLine` | **caught** |
| Mouse: the wheel over a pane that asked for the mouse | n/a, never broken | same binary | none, and that is correct: `TestMouseTrackingAppKeepsItsOwnWheel` passes on both, because it guards behaviour that already worked | **guard, not a control** |
| Clipboard: every mouse release copies, so a bare single click clobbers the clipboard | n/a, injected | `deliberate := moved \|\| window.ClickCount >= 2` → `deliberate := true` in `internal/input/mouse_select.go` | `TestDoubleClickCopiesAWordAndTripleClickTheLine` ("the gesture wrote the clipboard more times than it should: got [\"b\"], want []") | **caught, and invisible before this change** |
| Drag state never cleared on release, so one click freezes every pane forever | n/a, injected | drop `o.Dragging = false` from the copy-mode branch of `handleMouseRelease` | `TestClickInPaneDoesNotFreezeOutput` | **caught, and invisible before this change** |
| Agent-state feature absent (no verb, no indicator) | whole feature | build `origin/main` and point `TUIOS_E2E_BIN` at it | `TestAgentStateIndicatorRenders` (fails at the set step: `Unknown command "set-agent-state"`) | **caught** |
| Two clients with different chrome laid the panes out in different boxes, dragging the shared PTYs between the two answers | n/a, see verdict | `paneReserve` in `internal/app/os_geometry.go` returns `m.OwnLayoutReserve()` instead of folding in `m.SessionReserve` | none | **not caught**, see below |
| Pane body one column wider than the renderer vouches for, with the wrap skipped | n/a, injected | append a space to every row of the cell loop's output in `internal/app/render_terminal.go` while still reporting `maxX` | `TestWideRunesKeepThePaneRectangleOnScreen` ("pane has no right border glyph beside its content at column 119, its body is not 78 columns wide"), `TestSkippingTheWrapDrawsTheSameScreenAsWrapping` | **caught** |
| A workspace round trip threw away where the strip was scrolled to | n/a, see verdict | `ScrollingOnFocusChange` in `internal/app/os_scrolling.go` calls `sl.ScrollToFocusedColumn` instead of `sl.EnsureFocusedVisible` | `TestWorkspaceRoundTripKeepsTheScrolledStrip` ("a workspace round trip moved the strip. The focused column was on screen the whole time") | **caught** |
| The strip stops revealing a focused column with none of it on screen | n/a, injected | `EnsureFocusedVisible` in `internal/layout/scrolling.go` returns without calling `reveal` | `TestWorkspaceRoundTripRevealsAHiddenColumn` ("the round trip left the focused column off screen") | **caught**, and it is the positive control on the row above |
| A click that only focuses a borderless pane untiled it, resized it, and retiled it, so the shell took two SIGWINCH and printed a new line | n/a, see verdict | put the untile back on the press: move the `win.Tiled = false` / `win.Resize` pair from `untilePaneForDrag` (called from the drag branch of `handleMouseMotion`) back into `beginWindowDrag` in `internal/input/mouse_click.go` | `TestClickToFocusAddsNoLineToThePane` ("the pane took 6 resizes across three click-to-focus round trips") | **caught** |
| A pane being dragged keeps the borderless allowance, so it draws no border | n/a, injected | make `untilePaneForDrag` return before it clears `Tiled` | `TestDraggingAPaneDoesResizeIt`, since replaced by `TestDraggingTheDividerResizesOnce` | **caught** at the time; see the drag-announcement rows below for why that test is gone |
| A drag announced every size it passed through, so rearranging tiles left a new line in each pane | n/a, see verdict | drop `m.holdGestureAnnouncements()` from the `tea.MouseClickMsg` case in `internal/app/update.go` | `TestDragIntoASameSizeSlotResizesNothing` ("the pane took 2 resizes across a drag that returned it to the same size"), `TestDragIntoADifferentSizeSlotResizesOnce` ("announced 3 of them, want 1"); unit `TestDragBackIntoASameSizeSlotTellsTheGuestNothing` (since removed) | **caught** |
| Nothing ends the hold, so a pane never learns its size again | n/a, injected, cuts all four call sites | drop `o.ReleaseGestureAnnouncements()` from the release defer in `internal/input/mouse_release.go` and from the `MouseReleaseMsg` case in `internal/input/handler.go`, `m.releaseGestureAnnouncements()` from `endLostGesture`, and `m.releaseStaleAnnounceHold()` from the maintenance tick | `TestDraggingTheDividerResizesOnce` ("announced 0 resizes, want 1"), `TestDragIntoADifferentSizeSlotResizesOnce` ("announced 0 of them, want 1"); unit `TestDraggingTheDividerTellsTheGuestOnce` | **caught**, and it is the positive control on the row above |
| The release handler alone stops ending the hold | n/a, injected | drop only the two `o.ReleaseGestureAnnouncements()` calls in `internal/input` | none here, and that is correct: the maintenance tick's backstop still ends the hold inside the three seconds these tests wait, which is the redundancy it exists for. Unit `TestDraggingTheDividerTellsTheGuestOnce` fails ("told the guest [], want one size") | **not caught here, caught in `internal/input`** |
| The idle diet sleeps through a stranded hold | n/a, injected, cuts the call site | make the `m.staleAnnounceHold()` branch in `tickNeedsWork` unreachable, or drop `m.releaseStaleAnnounceHold()` from the tick body | unit `TestAReleaseThatWentMissingStillEndsTheHold`, `TestAPointerGoneSilentStillEndsTheHold` ("the hold survived a tick with no button held") | **caught in `internal/app`** |
| A retile inside a gesture ends the gesture's own hold | n/a, injected | `ReleaseAnnouncements` in `internal/terminal/window_geometry.go` back to clearing the count instead of decrementing it | none here; unit `TestALayoutUpdateInsideAGestureDoesNotEndItsHold` ("a layout update inside the gesture told the pane [[58 28]]") | **not caught here, caught in `internal/app`** |
| Keyboard focus resizes the pane it moves to (a report from macOS, after the click and drag fixes; no keyboard path does this on Linux, so there is nothing to remove) | n/a, injected | add `Resize(Width-1, Height)` then `Resize(Width+1, Height)` to `FocusWindow` in `internal/app/os_window.go`, after the cache invalidation, and point `TUIOS_E2E_BIN` at that build | `TestFocusTabAddsNoLine`, `TestFocusAltArrowsAddNoLine`, `TestFocusAltArrowsStandaloneAddNoLine`, `TestFocusAltArrowsScrollingAddNoLine` (each "the pane took 3 resizes across ..., and printed a line for each"); positive half `TestSwapIntoANarrowerSlotIsTold` in the same fixture | **caught** (4 of 4 run) |
| The same, with fish in the panes, animations on, a simulated kitty host and the ghostty backend, after a recording showed the bug with fish on macOS | n/a, injected | the same `FocusWindow` mutant | `TestFocusAltArrowsFishAddNoLine`, `TestFocusTabFishAddsNoLine` ("the pane took 3 resizes") | **caught** |
| The render trace stops recording the sizes handed to a guest, so the diagnostic the macOS report is asked to run says nothing | n/a, injected, cuts the wiring | drop `terminal.AnnounceTrace = traceAnnounce` from the `init` in `internal/app/render_trace.go` and point `TUIOS_E2E_BIN` at that build | `TestRenderTraceRecordsEachAnnouncement` ("the trace holds 0 announce lines after a swap of two panes, want at least 2"); unit `TestAnnounceTraceSeesEverySizeHandedToTheGuest` (since removed) fails when the call in `tellGuest` is cut ("a resize to 80x40 traced [], want [[80 40]]"), and a unit test, since removed, failed when the `LogBasic` in `PTY.Resize` was cut ("log has 0 lines") | **caught** |
| Two clients whose configs disagree on shared borders partitioned the box with different arithmetic, dragging the shared PTYs between the two answers | whole change | build the pre-fix tree (`20f17bbd`) and point `TUIOS_E2E_BIN` at it | `TestGeometryConfigDisagreementDoesNotMovePanes` ("the second client's attach moved the panes": 61,0 59x38 dragged to 60,0 60x38) | **caught** |
| Raising a floating pane reshuffled the others: `RecalcZOrder` renumbered by list position | n/a, injected | drop the `slices.SortStableFunc` over the current Z in `internal/app/os_window.go` | `TestClickingAPaneKeepsTheOthersInOrder` ("clicking A put C over B"); unit `TestRecalcZOrderKeepsTheStackingOrder` | **caught** |
| Floating band unbounded at 999 plus Z, over the which-key overlay, the clock, the log viewer and the scrollback browser | n/a, injected | `ZIndexSeparators`/`ZIndexAnimating` back to 998/999 and `windowLayerZ` back to `ZIndexSeparators + 1 + Z` | `TestAFloatingPaneStaysUnderTheWhichKeyOverlay` ("row 33 still shows the floating pane through the which-key overlay"); unit `TestFloatingWindowsStayBelowEveryOverlay` | **caught** |

| A peer that watched tiling turn off kept its panes borderless | n/a, injected | gate the `tilingWasOn && !m.AutoTiling` case in `ApplyStateSync` behind `false` | `TestAPeerSeesTilingTurnOff` ("the peer: 0 pane corners on screen, want 2"); unit `TestPeerTurningTilingOffClearsTheBorderFlags` (since removed) | **caught** |
| The rest of the tiling-switch change: the fresh tree on enable, the stale-tree rebuild, the palette row's own copy, the preselection left armed, the float's column left in the strip, a dragged float under the other floats, the minimized pane's border flag, session-info saying `bsp`, and a door that never flips | n/a, injected, one hunk each | see `internal/app/tiling_switch_test.go`; nine mutations | unit tests only, each fails as an assertion | **caught** (14 of 14 mutations in this change) |
| The spotlight dimmed the text outside the beam and left the screen that text sat on lit, at every setting up to the maximum | n/a, injected | `buildRun` in `internal/app/spotlight.go` blends the background toward `s.groundBg` again instead of `spotlightDark` | `TestSpotlightTurnsTheBackgroundDownOnScreen` ("the background outside the beam carries 114 of light against the ground's 106"); unit `TestSpotlightTurnsTheLightDownOnTheBackground` (since removed), `TestSpotlightDimsALightThemeDownwards` | **caught** |

| Nothing read the pointer's position into the beam | n/a, injected, cuts the call site | drop the `LastMouseX`/`LastMouseY` branch from `spotlightAnchor` in `internal/app/spotlight.go` | `TestSpotlightFollowsTheMouse` | **caught** |
| Blur left the last pointer shape standing: the terminal paints the last OSC 22 it was sent wherever the pointer lands after refocus, so resize arrows sat over pane content | whole change | build main before the fix (the `m.ResetPointerShape()` in the `tea.BlurMsg` case of `internal/app/update.go` is the whole fix) and point `TUIOS_E2E_BIN` at it | `TestBlurRetiresThePointerShape` ("after the host lost focus: the host pointer shape is \"nwse-resize\", want \"default\"") | **caught** |
| A new BSP window split the last pane in the tree, the bottom-right one, whatever had focus, and a daemon session dropped the preselection (discussion #347) | whole change | build `origin/main` before the fix and point `TUIOS_E2E_BIN` at it | `TestBSPNewWindowSplitsTheFocusedPane`, all six cases ("the new pane is not inside the focused pane's old box": the new pane split the pane at 80,23), `TestBSPNewWindowSplitsTheFocusedPaneStandalone`, all three cases ("pane {X:80 Y:23 ...} moved") | **caught** |

| A daemon session drops the preselection on its way to the sync | n/a, injected, cuts the call site | make the `m.PreselectionDir` branch in the daemon half of `AddWindowIn` in `internal/app/os_window.go` unreachable | `TestBSPNewWindowSplitsTheFocusedPane`, the four preselect cases ("the new pane is not left of the focused pane", and above, below, right of); the two cases with no preselection pass, which is their positive half | **caught** |
| The standalone TUI stops splitting the focused pane | n/a, injected, cuts the call site | drop `targetID = fw.ID` from `AddWindowToBSPTree` in `internal/app/tiling_bsp.go` | `TestBSPNewWindowSplitsTheFocusedPaneStandalone`, all three cases; the daemon test passes, since that path does not run there | **caught** |
| An `a=T` carrying `U=1` (ntcharts/picture, `kitten icat --unicode-placeholder`) was treated as a real placement: rows reserved, which scrolled the guest's screen every frame, and the image placed at the cursor | whole change | stash the five hunks in `internal/app/kitty_passthrough_forward.go`, `kitty_file_medium.go`, `kitty_passthrough.go`, `kitty_passthrough_lifecycle.go` and `internal/vt/utf8.go` | `TestKittyVirtualPlacementLeavesThePaneToTheGuest/b64`, `/file`, `/daemon-b64` ("39 placements were drawn at a cursor position", "the guest's PLACEHOLDER-HEADER is gone from the pane"), `TestKittyPlaceholderSplitAcrossWritesNamesTheHostImage`, `TestKittyPlaceholdersPrintedBeforeTheImageNameIt` | **caught** (3 of 3 transports run; `/shm` skips without `/dev/shm`) |
| The same, the row reservation alone | n/a, injected, cuts the call site | drop the `if cmd.Virtual { break }` from the `TransmitPlace` case of `ForwardCommand` | `/file` ("PLACEHOLDER-HEADER is gone"); `/b64` passes, and that is correct: a chunked transmission's last chunk arrives as `a=t` and never reaches that branch | **caught** |
| The same, the chunked direct path alone | n/a, injected, cuts the call site | drop the `pending.AndPlace && pending.Virtual` block from `forwardTransmit` | `/b64`, `/daemon-b64` ("no virtual placement reached the host", "39 placements were drawn at a cursor position"), and the split and early tests through the lost text | **caught** |

| A daemon state broadcast flipped a streamed pane back to the normal screen, and the passthrough deleted the alternate-screen image | n/a, injected, cuts the call site | `updateWindowFromState` in `internal/app/session.go` calls `w.SetAltScreen(ws.IsAltScreen)` for every window again, without the `SubscribedPTYs` check (the tree before the fix) | `TestKittyAltScreenImageSurvivesStateSync` ("a daemon state broadcast took the image down: a=d a=d,d=i,i=1,q=2") | **caught** |

A first version of the test checked only the dock rule and passed on this mutant, because the dock is drawn over the rail. It now checks the rail's footer row too |

A first mutant changed only the verb and left the struct reading `window_size`, so it read nothing, fell back to the smallest wording and passed. The control now restores the whole function |

| Two control calls on one link read each other's replies | n/a, injected, cuts the fix | drop the `lockOrDone(ctx, &c.one)` pair from `caller.call` in `internal/federation/call.go` | `TestTwoListingsAtOnceDoNotReadEachOthersAnswers` **panics** rather than asserting: two goroutines on one `bufio.Reader` crash the daemon | **not caught as an assertion**, and the panic is the shipped behaviour at `3aebb8da` |
| The rail never learns of a host added from the command line: a client whose daemon has no hosts stops polling for them, which is the default install | n/a, injected, cuts the call site | drop `d.broadcastHostsChanged(change)` from `ApplyHosts` in `internal/session/daemon_hosts.go` | `TestRailShowsAHostAddedWhileAttached` ("the rail did not show the host added while the client was attached") | **caught** |
| The client takes the daemon's push and never re-arms its own poll gate | n/a, injected, cuts the wiring | the `HostsChangedMsg` case in `internal/app/update.go` returns `m, nil` | `TestRailShowsAHostAddedWhileAttached`; unit `TestHostsChangedPushStartsThePollAgain` ("the hosts-changed push did not arm the poll") (since removed) | **caught** |
| Clicking a session on another machine hoists that machine to the top of the section, so the row that was clicked moves out from under the pointer and every other row moves with it | n/a, injected, restores the layout this change replaced | `sidebarMachineRows` in `internal/app/sidebar_hosts.go` pins `attached` first instead of `federation.LocalHostName` | `TestRailAttachesARemoteSessionInThisClient` ("the row \"▾ local\" moved from screen row 1 to 3 on the switch"); unit `TestMachineOrderHoldsAcrossASwitch` | **caught** |
| A machine's group does not fold | n/a, injected, cuts the wiring | invert the empty-name guard in `SidebarToggleHostCollapsed` so every call returns early | `TestRailAttachesARemoteSessionInThisClient` ("the click on the header did not fold the group"); the unit test that also failed has since been removed | **caught** |
| A folded machine header does not say how many sessions it is holding, so the fold reads as an empty machine | n/a, injected | gate the `collapsed && node.WindowCount > 0` case of `sidebarHostRow` behind `false` | `TestRailAttachesARemoteSessionInThisClient` ("the click on the header did not fold the group": the wait reads the count) | **caught** |
| The machine header wears "@" again, which is the mark the report asked to be rid of | n/a, injected | `GetRailFoldOpenGlyph` in `internal/config/glyphs.go` returns "@" in both glyph modes | unit `TestSidebarDrawsHostGroups` ("the rail still marks a machine with @") (since removed) | **caught in `internal/app`** |
| Folding the attached machine hides the row wearing the focus mark, so "where am I" leaves the rail | n/a, injected | `sidebarHostRow` passes `false` to `sidebarGutter` instead of `here && collapsed` | an `internal/app` unit test failed ("the folded header of the attached machine does not wear the focus mark"); it was since removed, and not rerun against anything that replaced it | **caught in `internal/app` at the time; that test was removed** |
| The machine order, the folds and the per-machine session orders are never written to the sidebar state file | n/a, injected | `saveSidebarState` in `internal/app/sidebar_state.go` writes `nil` for `HostsOrder`, `HostsCollapsed` and `HostSessionOrder` | unit `TestSidebarStatePersistsTheMachineLayout` ("the state file has no \"hosts_order\"") | **caught in `internal/app`** |
| One drag order is shared across every machine, so a drag while attached on build writes build's session names over this machine's order | n/a, injected | `sidebarSessionOrderFor` in `internal/app/sidebar_hosts.go` returns `m.SidebarOrder` for every host | unit `TestRemoteSessionOrderIsPerMachine` ("build's rows ignore build's order") | **caught in `internal/app`** |
| A session row on a machine that answers is muted like one on a machine that does not, so the ink says less than the row does: a click on it attaches the session | n/a, injected, restores the ink this change replaced | `sidebarRemoteSessionRow` in `internal/app/sidebar_hosts.go` back to a flat `pal.FgMute` | unit `TestRailInksARemoteRowByItsLink` ("the row of a session on a machine that answers is not drawn in the resting ink") (since removed) | **caught in `internal/app`** |

| A rail too narrow for a name and a number keeps the number on a machine's rows and drops it on this machine's, so the same row type answers the width two ways | n/a, injected | drop `variant == sidebarVariantFull` from the count in `sidebarRemoteSessionRow` in `internal/app/sidebar_hosts.go` | an `internal/app` unit test failed ("a row on another machine keeps its count on a rail too narrow for one"), whose positive half was the same row carrying the count at the full variant; it was since removed, and not rerun against anything that replaced it | **caught in `internal/app` at the time; that test was removed** |
| The width never reaches the row: `drawHostRow` takes the variant and hands the row a constant | n/a, injected, cuts the wiring | `drawHostRow` passes `sidebarVariantFull` to `sidebarRemoteSessionRow` instead of `variant` | the same removed unit test, which drove `drawHostRow` rather than the row function for this reason | **caught in `internal/app` at the time; that test was removed** |
| A drag on a machine header draws its draft order and throws it away on release, so the rail snaps back | n/a, injected, cuts the wiring | drop `m.SidebarHostOrder = d.Order` from the host branch of `SidebarRelease` in `internal/app/sidebar_mouse.go` | `TestDraggingAMachineHeaderReordersTheRail` ("the drag did not put offline above build") | **caught** |
| The reconnect tests read "@ local" to mean "this client is on build". The machine groups removed that row, so the three assertions were re-spelled as the rail's focus mark | n/a, see verdict | the two tests are each other's halves in one helper, which is rule 1 above: `TestALinkThatDropsIsDialedAgainAndThePaneComesBack` passes only while `home` is **not** marked current, and `TestAHostThatNeverComesBackGivesUpAndSaysWhy` passes only when it **is** | `TestAHostSessionStaysAttached` also fails on a mark that never moves, which `order-hoists-attached` and `fold-is-a-noop` above both demonstrate | **not weakened** |
| The review cursor stepped onto each wrapped row of a note, and only the row under it was drawn selected | n/a, injected, cuts the wiring | `ReviewMove` in `internal/app/review_overlay.go` sets `r.cursor = min(max(r.cursor+delta, 0), len(rows)-1)` instead of calling `reviewStep` | `TestReviewWrappedNoteIsOneStop` ("j past the note: mark on row 5, want row 9") | **caught** |
| `attach --host NAME --ssh` with no `--command` sends a bare `tuios`, so a host whose tuios is only in `~/.local/bin` says "not found" | n/a, injected, cuts the call site | `OpenArgs` in `internal/federation/open.go` sends `h.Command` (or `tuios` when it is empty) with the arguments instead of `h.remoteCommand(false, ...)`, so the probe never runs | `TestAttachOnAHostWithSSHFindsTuiosOutsideThePath` ("the far tuios in ~/.local/bin never drew the session over --ssh: child exited (code 1)"); `TestAttachOnAHostWithSSHRunsTheFarTuios` passes, correctly, since its host has a configured command | **caught** (macOS) |
| `attach --ssh` is ignored and the session is attached over the link, so the far tuios never runs | n/a, injected, cuts the wiring | `runAttachOnHost(..., attachSSH)` in `cmd/tuios/main.go` passes `false` | `TestAttachOnAHostWithSSHRunsTheFarTuios` ("no nested client for nested-target"), `TestAttachOnAHostWithSSHFindsTuiosOutsideThePath` ("--ssh did not run the tuios found at .../far-home/.local/bin/tuios") | **caught** (macOS), and only since the process list is read with `ps`, see below |
| A link attach runs ssh and a nested far client instead | n/a, injected, cuts the wiring | the same call passes `true` | `TestAttachOnAHostIsDrawnByThisClient` ("a nested client is running for far-shell: .../tuios attach far-shell"). With the old `pgrep -af` helper on macOS, `noNestedClient` stayed silent and the test failed 10 seconds later on an unrelated wait for the rail | **caught** (macOS), see below |
| On a one-line agent row the harness prefix was kept while two cells of the name were left, so a narrow rail read "claude/depl…" | whole change | build the tree before it (`a44708fe`) and point `TUIOS_E2E_BIN` at it | `TestNarrowRailKeepsTheAgentNameBeforeItsHarness` ("the rail cut the agent's name \"deploy\" to make room for its harness; agent rows: [\"│▎● claude/depl…\" ...]") | **caught** |
| The same, with only the call site cut | n/a, injected, cuts the call site | the `sidebarAgentPrefixRun` call in `sidebarAgentRow` (`internal/app/render_sidebar.go`) passes `min(nameW, 2)` instead of `nameW`, which is the old two-cell rule | `TestNarrowRailKeepsTheAgentNameBeforeItsHarness`, the same assertion. The unit test calls the function directly and does not see this cut | **caught** |
| The rail draws no prefix at all, which would pass the name half for the wrong reason | n/a, injected | the same call passes `nil` for the tokens | `TestNarrowRailKeepsTheAgentNameBeforeItsHarness` ("the rail never drew the short agent with its harness"), which is its positive half: `db` still has room for `claude/` | **caught** |
| A 16-column rail kept the word beside a machine's name and cut the name, so a header read "wo… offline" (issue 181) | whole change | build the tree before it (`07a467ca`) and point `TUIOS_E2E_BIN` at it | `TestTheNarrowRailNamesAMachineWhole/narrow` ("the rail cut the machine's name at width 16: \" ▾ wo…  offline│\""). The `wide` half passes on both builds, which is its job | **caught** |
| An agent row dropped its last token first, so a long name took the cells of the state after it (issue 181) | whole change | the same build | `TestNarrowRailKeepsWhatAnAgentIsDoing/state` ("the long name took the cells of the state beside it: \"│▎● deploy-the-api-gate…\"") | **caught** |
| The harness prefix is budgeted like any other token, so it is kept beside a long name cut to its eight-cell keep | n/a, injected | `sidebarAgentBudget` in `internal/app/sidebar_agent_tokens.go` builds the prefix tokens with `Whole: false` | `TestNarrowRailKeepsWhatAnAgentIsDoing/shipped` ("the row kept a prefix beside a name it had cut: \"│▎● claude/deploy-the-a…\""). `TestNarrowRailKeepsTheAgentNameBeforeItsHarness` passes on this build: "deploy" is shorter than the keep, so the two rules agree on it | **caught** |
| `-w` took a unique id prefix before an exact name, so a pane named with hex digits ("db") was missed whenever another pane's uuid started with them: set-agent-state reported success and set the other pane. This was the "lost agent state" flake in `TestNarrowRailKeepsTheAgentNameBeforeItsHarness`, about 2 in 100 | n/a, the build before the fix | `findWindowStateIndex` in `internal/session/session_ops.go` as it was, trying the id prefix before the names | `TestAWindowNameWinsOverAnIdPrefix`, 3 of 3 runs ("the pane named \"d07e9a9b\" is at \"none\", want working"; "the pane whose id starts with ... took the state meant for the pane of that name"). The same build failed `TestNarrowRailKeepsTheAgentNameBeforeItsHarness` 5 times in 300 runs, run beside a second copy of the loop; with the fix it passed 300 of 300 under the same load. A shell loop of the rail test's CLI steps, eight at a time, lost the state on `db` 8 times in 200 before the fix, every time with another pane's id starting with `db`, and 0 times in 320 after | **caught** |
| A client push carrying agent fields kept them over the daemon's, so a stale snapshot could put an old agent state back; the foreground command, shell pid, directory and machine were taken from the push the same way whenever it named one | n/a, the build before the fix | `retainDaemonExclusive` in `internal/session/state_merge.go` as it was. No E2E test reaches this: the TUI never sends these fields, so only a raw socket client could | the unit cases in `TestAClientSyncKeepsTheDaemonsWindowFields` ("a stale agent state in the push", "a stale foreground command, pid and directory in the push") and `TestTheMachineIsCarriedByWindow` ("named differently") all fail | **caught** (unit) |
| Teardown: a process that is still running passes the teardown check | n/a, injected into the fixture | the check is tuitest's own again, from 8db5fa3 on (pinned at 8912ebb), which counts a process in X as exited: every terminal starts through `tuitest.StartT`, and the `closeTerm` workaround that re-read its survivor list is gone. Rerun against `StartT` alone: a throwaway test starts `/bin/sh` with a child that calls `setsid` and takes root as its real uid through a setuid bit, so its owner cannot signal it. Linux container (golang:1.26), test run as an unprivileged user | "tuitest: ptyproc: 1 process(es) survived teardown: [2552]" on 8db5fa3 and "[2663]" on 8912ebb, and the test fails. Its positive half, the same shell with an ordinary `sleep` child, passes. The earlier run of this control against `closeTerm` failed `TestFocusAltArrowsPixelHostAddNoLine` the same way ("survived teardown: [1586465]"), and its positive half, 2000 teardowns under fork load with a process caught in X twice and passed, is what 8db5fa3 moved into tuitest | **caught** |
| The rail learned about another session's agent from the 3 second listing poll while the dock said it at once | n/a, injected | `foreignAgentRefreshCmd` in `internal/app/inbox.go` returns nil | `TestRailMarksAForeignAgentWhenTheDockDoes` ("the rail did not mark e2e-ask-a within 1.2s of its agent asking"), 3 of 3 runs | **caught** |
| A straight box-drawing line in a capture was two arms meeting mid-cell, so every row of a border had a notch | n/a, the build before the fix | `drawArms` in `internal/shot/boxdraw.go` without the one-rect case for two equal arms on one axis | `TestScreenshotDrawsAStraightBorderWithoutNotches` ("the stroke at x=8 loses ink at y=16: 417 against 556") | **caught** |
| On a light theme the rail and the dock wrote the dark ramp's near-white inks on the theme's near-white ground | n/a, injected | `GroundUI` in `internal/theme/ui.go` returns `UI()` unchanged | `TestLightThemeRailAndDockAreReadable` (session names and the dock notice at 1.09:1 against a 4.5:1 floor) | **caught** |
| An Inbox that opened empty and then filled kept the empty state's top, so the full list sat on the bottom edge | n/a, injected | `overlayAnchorY` in `internal/app/overlay_hit.go` returns the held top whenever the screen height is unchanged | `TestInboxThatFillsAfterOpeningIsCentred` ("13 rows above it and 1 below") | **caught** |
| The review footer kept a margin on its left only, so a key strip that fitted to the cell ran into the frame | n/a, injected | `reviewHints` in `internal/app/render_review.go` fits against `width-1` | `TestReviewFooterKeepsItsRightMargin` (footer ends "esc close│") | **caught** |
| The review's "too narrow for two columns" line stayed over the unified view it had recommended | n/a, injected | the `statusID` reset in `ReviewToggleSplit` disabled | `TestReviewNarrowSplitNoticeGoesWithTheSplit` (still on screen 2s after the second s) | **caught** |
| A panel wider than the panes' columns covered all of the rail but a column or two, leaving fragments of its rows down the panel's edge | n/a, injected | `panelCenterX` in `internal/app/overlay_hit.go` centres on the screen alone | `TestAPanelWiderThanThePanesCoversTheWholeRail` (row 2 ends in the rail's ground) | **caught** |
| The which-key overlay took the screen's bottom-right corner and sat over the rail with two of its columns showing | n/a, injected | the which-key corners taken from the whole screen in `internal/app/render_overlays.go` | `TestWhichKeySitsBesideTheRail` (row 2 of the rail changed under the overlay) | **caught** |
| The which-key list was cut to the screen's rows and ran up over a dock at the top | n/a, injected | the list measured from the top of the screen in `internal/app/render_overlays.go` | `TestWhichKeySitsBesideTheRail` ("the which-key title is on row 1, over the dock") | **caught** |
| A panel taller than the rows under a dock at the top was fitted to the whole screen and ran up over the dock | n/a, injected | `panelRoomHeight` returns the screen's rows and `overlayOrigin` places from row 0 | `TestATallPanelStaysUnderTheDock` (the settings page covered the dock's pills) | **caught** |
| A session made by a command with no terminal (a script, CI, an agent) gave every pane TERM=dumb, so `clear` did nothing and full-screen programs ran without cursor movement | n/a, the build before the fix | `sendHello` in `internal/session/client.go` without the case that names no TERM when detection answers dumb and stdout is not a terminal | `TestSessionMadeWithoutATerminalGivesItsPanesARealTerm` ("gave its pane \"TERM=dumb COLORTERM=truecolor\"") on macOS; in an ubuntu:24.04 container with TERM=dumb, as on a GitHub runner, `TestScreenshotDrawsAStraightBorderWithoutNotches` also fails ("the stroke at x=8 runs from 5 to 9": the typed command stayed on row 0), which is how CI found it | **caught** |
| Every box-drawing rule and border in a capture had a faint brighter nub beside it at each cell boundary, because each cell overdrew half a pixel into its neighbours and the overlap drew the stroke's anti-aliased edge twice | n/a, the build before the fix | `internal/shot/boxdraw.go`, `png.go` and `svg.go` as of b0ab22a1, with `rect` bleeding past every cell edge it touches | `TestScreenshotDrawsAHorizontalRuleWithoutNubs` ("row y=15 of the rule is not one colour: 439 at x=16 against 378 at its start (x=0)") | **caught** |
| The chrome was drawn in truecolor and stepped down a colour at a time: panels and the selected row navy (17) at 256 colours, and at 16 a blue (4) ground and panels with no edge | whole change | build `origin/main` (c2a16426) and point `TUIOS_E2E_BIN` at it | `TestChromeAtEveryColourDepth` dark-16, light-16 ("ground index 4"), dark-256, light-256 ("ground index 17"); the two truecolor runs pass on both builds, which is their positive half | **caught** |
| The same, with the depth cut at its wiring | n/a, injected | `theme.SetColorProfile` no longer calls `overlay.SetDepth` | `TestChromeAtEveryColourDepth` 16 and 256 runs, dark and light ("ground index 17" / "ground index 4"); truecolor passes | **caught** |
| At 16 colours the command palette's selected row has no ground and nothing in its place | n/a, injected | `renderCommandPalette` appends `paletteRow(...)` without `pal.Row` | `TestChromeAtEveryColourDepth` dark-16 and light-16 ("selected row cell (16,16) is not reverse video"); 256 and truecolor pass | **caught** |
| At 16 colours a workspace pill's fill is the terminal's own ground, and its caps were drawn in the default ink, so white half circles framed a label on nothing and read as brackets | whole fix | the wave01/final merge before the fix (`workspacePill` without its `overlay.IsNoColor(ground)` branch), pointed to by `TUIOS_E2E_BIN` | `TestChromeAtEveryColourDepth` dark-16 and light-16 ("pill cap ... is drawn in the default ink"); the 256 and truecolor runs pass on both builds, which is their positive half | **caught** |
| At 16 colours a chip on a light slot took the light ink: the PREFIX badge was slot 15 on slot 3, which a light theme paints close to its own ground, because `ContrastText` measured a slot as the dim VGA colour | whole fix | the build before the fix (`ContrastText` without `slotAsXTerm`), pointed to by `TUIOS_E2E_BIN` | `TestOverlayLayouts` dark-120x40-16 and light-120x40-16 ("is slot 15 on slot 3: light ink on a light ground"); the 256 and truecolor runs pass on both builds, which is their positive half | **caught** |
| A list without the keyboard hid its cursor: the review's file list while the diff is focused, and the diff's cursor while the list is | whole change | build `origin/main` (c2a16426) | `TestUnfocusedListKeepsItsCursor` truecolor ("sits on the resting ground") and 16 ("want underlined") | **caught** |

| The review diff's tints were stepped down a colour at a time: an added and a removed line on the same grey at 256 colours (239 dark, 253 light), and at 16 colours on a painted ground with no mark on the changed words | whole change | build `wave1/colors` (e5baef1b) and point `TUIOS_E2E_BIN` at it | `TestReviewDiffAtEveryColourDepth` dark-256 ("the removed line's ground is ... 239, want palette entry 52"), light-256 ("... 253, want palette entry 224"), dark-16 and light-16 ("the ... line's code has ground ... at 16 colours"); the two truecolor runs pass on both builds, which is their positive half | **caught** |
| A saturated colour stepped down to 256 landed on a grey: `colorprofile` places Catppuccin Latte's red on 241, so a removed line's number was grey | n/a, injected | `overlay.To256` returns `colorprofile.ANSI256.Convert(c)` instead of `nearest256(c)` | `TestReviewDiffAtEveryColourDepth/light-256` ("the removed line's number is drawn in ... Index:241, a grey"); dark-256 passes | **caught** |
| At 16 colours the diff's cursor reversed the whole row, which drops the code's colours | n/a, injected | `reviewDraw.row` finishes line rows with `pal.Mark` over the whole row, as for the other rows | `TestReviewDiffAtEveryColourDepth` dark-16 and light-16 ("the code under the cursor is reversed") | **caught** |

| The palette lists its commands with no category headers | n/a, injected, cuts the wiring | `paletteGrouped` in `internal/app/command_palette.go` returns false | `TestOverlayLayouts` dark-120x40-truecolor and light-80x24-truecolor ("the palette's first row is \"› Run a program alt+space Run\", want the Run header") | **caught** |

| An empty list says so in a line at its top left, with no key to press | n/a, injected, cuts the call site | `renderListOverlay` in `internal/app/render_list_overlay.go` appends the message as one line instead of `overlay.Empty.Lines` | `TestOverlayLayouts` dark-120x40-truecolor ("\"No match for 'qqqq'\" is centred on column 30, the body's middle is 48", "no \"create it\" under \"No match\"") and light-80x24-truecolor | **caught** |

| The screen behind a modal overlay is not dimmed | n/a, injected | `composeLayers` no longer calls `m.applyScrim(canvas)` before the first modal layer | `TestModalDimsTheScreenBehind`, all six runs, dark and light at 16, 256 and truecolor ("not darker", "want faint", "the rail's session name ... was not dimmed") | **caught** |
| An overlay does not fade in | n/a, injected | `composeLayers` no longer calls `m.applyFade` after an overlay's layer | `TestOverlayFadesIn/truecolor-full` ("appeared at its final colour on every one of three opens"); `256-full` and `truecolor-basic`, which must not fade, pass, which is their positive half | **caught** |

| The motion clock runs with no working row on screen | n/a, injected | `shimmerActive` drops its `len(m.motion.rail) > 0` term | `TestFullMotionWithoutAgentsStaysIdle` ("motion=84"). The wire stayed at 0 bytes, because the extra frames drew nothing new: the client's own motion frame count is what catches it | **caught** |

| A quiet folder refresh rebuilt the rail twice, even with nothing changed, and ran up to ten times a second | whole change | keep the `rail=` count in `internal/app/tick_stats.go` and `sidebar_cache.go`, put the rest of `internal/app` back to the parent commit, and point `TUIOS_E2E_BIN` at that build | `TestRailFilesRefreshIsPaced/rename` (58 rebuilds, budget 25) and `/swap` (71 rebuilds, budget 12); with the change, 17 and 5.

| The daemon parses only the control keys of a graphics command and stopped answering EINVAL to a payload that is not base64 | n/a, injected | drop the `kittyPayloadErrorOwed` decode from the header-only branch of `parseKittyCommand` in `internal/vt/kitty_parser.go` | `TestKittyPayloadErrorReplies/daemon` (the `i=41;EINVAL` reply read "0 times, want once", the same for the query `i=42`, which got `OK`); `/standalone` passes, which is its positive half: the client decodes every payload. Unit `FuzzKittyHeader` fails on its seeds | **caught**. Removing `terminal.SetKittyHeaderOnly(true)` from `internal/session/session.go` is not caught, and that is correct: it changes CPU, not replies. `TestKittyHeaderLeavesThePayloadAlone` holds the parse to no payload copy |
| The header-only parse left `FilePath` empty for `t=s` and `t=t`, so the daemon had no name to delete and, with the shared memory cleanup (#341), every unread frame stayed in `/dev/shm` | n/a, injected, cuts the call site | make the `kittyHeaderNamesObject` case in the header-only branch of `parseKittyCommand` in `internal/vt/kitty_parser.go` never match | Unit `TestKittyHeaderNamesTheObject` (`t=s` and `t=t` named "", want the name); `t=d` and `t=f` stay unnamed, its positive half.

This is the negative half: cell reports reach the pane unchanged once 1016 is off | **caught** (2 of 2 run) |
| After $EDITOR, tuios still read every report as pixels: Bubble Tea writes 1006 when it takes the terminal back, which ends 1016, and the client state kept 1016 active | n/a, injected | in `internal/app/host_pixel_mouse.go`, make `forget` do nothing | `TestSGRPixelMouseAfterTheEditor/standalone` and `/daemon` ("the pane never got the report"; the pane got `PX35;54;5.`, the cell report divided by the cell size) | **caught** |

| The harness logged each client's PTY to an unbounded `pty.log`, and a client attached to a kitty stream wrote 473 MB in 19 s | n/a, cuts the call site | in `startIn` (`harness_test.go`), hand tuitest a plain `os.Create(logPath)` in place of `newBoundedLog` | `TestPtyLogStaysBounded` ("the pty log is 262094560 bytes, over its limit of 262144"); with the fix, 149203 bytes.

| A capped log that keeps its oldest bytes and stops writing at the limit, so a failure shows the start of the run, not the end | n/a, injected | in `boundedLog.Write` (`ptylog_test.go`), drop every write that would pass the limit | `TestPtyLogStaysBounded` ("the log lost its newest bytes: the last 4096 bytes sent to the host are not in it") | **caught** |
| A kitty stand-in killed by a signal left its object in `/dev/shm`, one per run of a shared memory test | n/a, cuts the call site | remove the `t.Cleanup` registration in `standInShmPrefix` (`ptylog_test.go`) | `TestKittyStandInShmRemovedAfterTest` ("1 shared memory objects stayed in /dev/shm after the test"). Positive half: the subtest asserts the object is still there after SIGKILL ends the stand-in | **caught** |
| `TestKittyStandInShmRemovedAfterTest` looked for the object once, right after the stand-in reported its geometry. The stand-in creates the object after that report, so the test failed when it looked first (main, run 37220244828) | n/a, injected | in `e2e/tui/frameloop/main.go`, sleep one second between `report` and `allocate`; run the test as it was | `TestKittyStandInShmRemovedAfterTest` ("the stand-in made no object with prefix"), the same message as CI. With the condition wait: passes with the delay, and 10 of 10 without it | **caught** |
| A pane that asked for releases got a press with no release while the host sent none (no protocol, or the moment before the host switched flags), so a compositor in the pane held the key and its client repeated it | whole change, then the call site | build `origin/main` (`4e689aa1`); then drop the `rawInput = append(rawInput, releaseNow...)` line in `internal/input/keyboard_terminal.go` | `TestPaneGetsReleaseTheHostCannotSend` ("the pane received `\x1b[120u`", the press alone) both times; positive half `TestPaneGetsRepeatAsRepeat`, where the host sends the release and the pane gets exactly one | **caught** |

| The lock modifiers were dropped for a pane that asked for every key, so a compositor in it could not learn that Num Lock was on | whole change, then the gate | `origin/main`; then make the report-all-keys gate in `kittyModParamFor` always return early | `TestPaneGetsLockState` both times; the negative half (no lock bits under disambiguate) is the `internal/vt` case `up, numlock on, has no lock bits` | **caught** |
| A multifocus peer got the focused pane's bytes, so a shell peer got kitty releases as text ("1:3u: command not found") | the call site | send `rawInput` to each peer instead of `paneKeyBytes(host, w, o, false)` in `internal/input/keyboard_terminal.go`; also the build before the change | `TestMultifocusPeerGetsItsOwnEncoding` (the shell never printed PEER-42) both times | **caught** |
| The leader pressed twice sent a press with no release | the call site | drop the release from the `paneKeyBytes` result in `forwardKeyToFocusedWindow`; also the build before the change | `TestLeaderTwiceGetsItsRelease` (the pane received the press alone) both times | **caught** |
| Enter, Tab and Backspace got CSI u and a release under event types without report-all-keys | the gate | remove the `isKittyLegacyTextKey` checks in `internal/vt/kitty_keyboard.go`; also the build before the change | `TestNoReleaseForEnterWithoutAllKeys`; unit `TestEncoderMatchesKitty` (49 and 13 mismatches against kitty's encoder) | **caught** |

| `agent-statusline` panicked with SIGSEGV when the daemon could not be dialed (issue #374): the dial closure returned a typed-nil `*VerbClient` and the deferred close called `Close` on it | whole change | build `origin/main` (`3f8df65b`) and point `TUIOS_E2E_BIN` at it | `TestStatusLineWithADeadDaemonStillRenders`, all four cases (missing and stale socket, with and without a named pane): "exit status 2", "panic: runtime error: invalid memory address or nil pointer dereference" | **caught** (4 of 4 run). Three layers each stop the crash on their own: the closures return an untyped nil, `reportStatusLine` assigns the client only after a good dial, and `Close` is safe on a nil receiver |
| A built-in theme with no cursor colour (horizon and 11 others) put a nil `*tint.Color` into a `color.Color`, so an OSC 12 query in a pane and `tuios list-themes horizon` panicked. Found in the #374 sweep | whole change | build `origin/main` (`3f8df65b`) and point `TUIOS_E2E_BIN` at it | `TestOSC12QueryUnderAThemeWithNoCursorColour/horizon` (the shell marker never came, the client died), `TestListThemesDescribesAThemeWithNoCursorColour` ("list-themes horizon failed: failed to read response: EOF"). The `dracula` halves pass on both builds, and are the positive half | **caught** |
| The emulator gets the theme's nil cursor as a non-nil `color.Color` again | n/a, injected, cuts the call site | `TerminalCursor` in `internal/theme/theme.go` returns `t.Cursor` instead of `AsColor(t.Cursor)` | `TestOSC12QueryUnderAThemeWithNoCursorColour/horizon`; `/dracula` passes. `TestListThemesDescribesAThemeWithNoCursorColour` passes, and that is correct: `Describe` has its own guard | **caught** |
| The width keys sent with send-keys resized the PTYs and left the tiles at equal shares: `RemoteKeysDoneMsg` dropped the workspace's BSP tree and tiled it again from nothing | the call site (the fix only deletes it) | build `origin/main` (`11335985`), which still has the rebuild | `TestWidthPercentAfterAClose` (screen two halves, daemon 32 and 128 columns), `TestWidthPercentWithNoClose` (the same with three panes). Positive half: `TestWidthPercentFromTheKeyboard`, the same keys on the client's keyboard, passes on both builds | **caught** |

| A Crush killed at its dialog leaves the pane on needs_input at the shell | n/a, injected, cuts the wiring | drop the herdr fields copy onto the blocker claim in `applyAgentReport` (`internal/session/agent_state.go`); separately, drop the blocker case from `herdrHeld` in `detectionPass` (`internal/session/agent_detect.go`) | `TestCrushCrashAtItsDialogClearsThePane` ("the pane is {State:needs_input ...}, want state none"), both controls; the PR head before the fix fails it too. A first version passed under both controls: in a short pane the shell's output after the kill scrolled the dialog off, and a pane with no dialog clears by another route. The test now runs in a tiled pane and checks that the dialog is still on the screen | **caught** |

Positive half: the pane is listed before it exits. `TestAPaneShownByFocusWindowStreamsItsOutput` passes on this build | **caught** |

| The first version of the #381 change, before review: a click on a clipboard ask opened the view, which cannot allow it; an 8000 byte OSC 9 with no spaces froze the client; a key press did not end the hover hold; the rail kept the view's keys; a paste reached the pane under the view; the leader was swallowed | that review's fixes | build the PR head before them (`c2e76b45`) | `TestClipboardAskIsAllowedByAClick` ("a click on the ask did not allow the write"), `TestLongNoSpaceMessageKeepsTheClientResponsive` ("the message view did not open in time"), `TestKeyPressEndsTheHold` ("the message stayed after a key press"), `TestViewersOverTheRailAndTheLeader` (leader, paste and rail steps) | **caught** |

| The 512 byte cap on a notification's text | n/a, injected | drop `capText` from `showNotification` and from the pane path in `internal/app/notify.go` | none. Correct: the linear `wrapPlain` and the wrap cache keep an 8000 byte message fast on their own. The cap bounds memory and the log | **not caught alone** |
| The linear `wrapPlain` | n/a, injected | put back the quadratic `wrapPlain` from `origin/main`, cap kept | none. Correct: under the 512 byte cap the quadratic version is fast enough. The PR head row above removes both and is caught | **not caught alone** |

| A dock component that floods its stdout fills the client's heap: the engine read all of it with `cmd.Output` before it cut it to 64 KiB | whole change | build `origin/main` (`2121db1c`) and point `TUIOS_E2E_BIN` at it | `TestDockFloodingComponentStaysBounded` ("the client holds 562344 KiB while a dock component floods its stdout (budget 307200 KiB)", 0.13s into the flood).

| The capped writer stops the flood but does not kill the command | n/a, injected | `kill` in the `dockCappedWriter` of `runOnce` in `internal/app/dock_engine.go` made a no-op | none. Correct: the failed write ends the copy, os/exec closes the pipe, and `yes` dies of SIGPIPE. The kill is for a command that ignores SIGPIPE, which costs CPU until the 3 s timeout and no memory | **not caught**, a redundancy |
| Bidi controls, C1 controls and invisible characters reach the host terminal from a dock cell | whole change | build `origin/main` (`2121db1c`) and point `TUIOS_E2E_BIN` at it; run the unit test against `origin/main`'s `dock_engine.go` | `TestDockComponentCannotSendUnsafeCharacters` (U+202E, U+009B and U+200B each on the wire); unit `TestDockSanitizeDropsUnsafeCharacters` (20 of 20 unsafe rows fail, 5 of 5 positive rows pass) | **caught** |

The raw 0x9B byte row still passes, because the invalid UTF-8 check drops it | **caught** |
| A terminal resize put the master-stack panes back to equal shares: only the master ratio and the ratio of a stack of exactly two were kept | whole change | point `TUIOS_E2E_BIN` at `origin/main` (`524e2f46`) | `TestMasterStackKeepsSplitsAcrossAResize/grid` ("pane 0 is 75 columns wide, want about 61.2"), `/stack-of-three` and `/no-shared-borders` ("pane 2 is 14 rows tall, want about 7.9"); `/stack-of-two` passes on both, its positive half: that split was already kept | **caught** (3 of 3) |

| Two clients attach, resize, drag, change the rail and leave under smallest and largest | n/a, never broken | `origin/main` (`524e2f46`) | none, and that is correct: `TestTwoClientsKeepOneLayout` passes on both. It checks the session size, the daemon's rectangles, each shell's size against its pane, the user's shares, a leave reaching the remaining client within a second, and the dock's client count | **guard, not a control** |
| A config save read by the watcher half written: `os.WriteFile` truncates and then fills the file, and a writer descheduled between the two for more than the 200 ms debounce let the watcher apply an empty or cut file. The completed save was then dropped as tuios's own | n/a, injected: a scheduling gap made deterministic | on `origin/main` (`ecb525ad`), `writeConfigBytes` in `internal/config/save.go` opens the file with `O_TRUNC` and sleeps 400 ms before it writes the bytes | `TestChromeSetFromTheCommandLineRetilesThePanes` ("the daemon after the dock is hidden: a pane is at row 2 and 38 rows tall, want row 0 and 40 rows"); the same 400 ms sleep put between the temporary file and its bytes on the fixed tree passes, with the config watch, live appearance and settings tests | **caught** with the gap injected. The CI failures of this test end with the panes at row 0 and 38 rows tall, a different shape, so this race is not proven to be their cause |

The e2e test keeps the SGR colour check as its positive half |
| A failed run kept the previous run's rows | n/a, injected | `applyUpdate` sets `text = c.text` instead of `text = ""` when `u.Err` is set | `TestRailCustomSectionEmptyOnFailure/exit` ("after the command failed: the rail still shows "GOOD"") | **caught**; the refresh after the fix is its positive half. Making the blank conditional on `!c.MultiLine` does nothing, because a failed run never carries text, so it is not a control |

### The mouse row is a whole-change control, not a single-hunk one

The mouse tests were written against a change whose whole point is a different
interaction, not against a bug with one faulty line, so the control is the
merge-base binary rather than a hunk revert:

```sh
git worktree add --detach /tmp/negctl origin/main
(cd /tmp/negctl && go build -o /tmp/tuios-main ./cmd/tuios)
cd e2e/tui && TUIOS_E2E=1 TUIOS_E2E_BIN=/tmp/tuios-main go test -count=1 \
  -run 'TestWheel|TestTypingWhileScrolled|TestMouseTracking|TestDragSelection|TestDoubleClick' -timeout 900s .
```

Each failure names the old behaviour: "COPY MODE" on the dock during a scroll,
`echo` never producing its marker because the keystrokes were eaten as vim
motions, and an empty list of clipboard writes because a drag moved the window
instead of selecting.

### Why the two blank-pane and torn-buffer entries are not caught, and what does cover them

**The blank-frame cache (`11a0023`)** needs a render to land in the gap between
a full-screen application clearing the alternate screen and painting it. Once
the application does paint, that output re-marks the window dirty and the pane
repairs itself, so a black-box observer sees the correct screen either way.
Widening the gap artificially does not help: during a deliberately long gap the
pane is legitimately blank on the fixed build too, so there is nothing to
distinguish. The fix's own commit message says the same thing, and its tests
assert on `renderTerminal`'s output and on the cache directly for exactly this
reason. Coverage lives in `internal/app/blank_alt_screen_cache_test.go`.

**The unlocked emulator resize (`fd1463e`)** is a data race. It corrupts the
cell buffer only when a state sync lands mid-write or mid-render, which needs
the race detector on tuios's own goroutines to observe reliably. This package
runs tuios as a child process, so `-race` on the test binary instruments the
harness and not the program under test. Coverage lives in
`internal/app/state_sync_race_test.go`, which floods a daemon window while
applying geometry-changing state syncs under `-race`.

**The shutdown WaitGroup race** is a data race in the daemon. A subscribe
writes its ack and then starts the event streamer on the daemon's WaitGroup.
A client that read the ack and stopped the daemon at once made that `Add` run
concurrently with shutdown's `Wait`. The same reason as above keeps it out of
this suite. Coverage lives in
`internal/session/shutdown_waitgroup_test.go`
(`TestSubscribeDuringStopRegistersNoGoroutine`), run under `-race`. The control
put `d.wg.Go` back at the call site in `startPendingStream`, with the
`goTracked` helper left in place. The test failed in 20 of 20 runs with the
call site cut and passed in 20 of 20 with the fix.

Those are genuine gaps in *this* suite, not in the project's coverage.
The general lesson is that end-to-end screen assertions are the right tool for
bugs whose symptom is a wrong screen that persists, and the wrong tool for bugs
whose symptom is a narrow timing window or a memory race.

## State deliveries ordered by change count

A client push keeps the state Version the same. The attach repair compared
Version, and the forward of a push to its peers ran outside `pushMu` with no
check. A peer push forwarded inside a repair let the repair's older snapshot
follow it, and of two pushes at once the older forward could reach the peers
last. The fix counts every change in `noteStateChangeLocked` and orders every
delivery by that count under `pushMu` (`Session.deliverPush`). The reconcile
reply to the pushing client goes the same way, through that client's
broadcast queue, so it can no longer overtake an older state queued ahead of
it. The tests are unit tests in `internal/session/state_push_order_test.go`.
Each lands the second change inside the first through a hook, so each fails
on every run.

| Bug | Fix removed | How | Tests that fail | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| A repair sent an older state behind a peer push, and the client ended on the workspace it had left | whole change | `session.go`, `daemon_handlers.go`, `daemon_stream.go` and `state_wait.go` as on main after #561, with only the two test hooks added | `TestAttachRepairDoesNotFollowAPeerPush` ("B read workspace 1 after workspace 7 (states in order: [7 1 7])") | **caught**, 50 of 50 runs; 0 of 50 with the fix |
| Of two pushes at once, the older forward reached the peers last | whole change | as above | `TestConcurrentPushesForwardInOrder` ("C read workspace 2 after workspace 3 (states in order: [3 2 3])") | **caught**, 50 of 50 runs; 0 of 50 with the fix |
| The reconcile reply overtook an older state queued to the same client | whole change | as above | `TestReconcileReplyDoesNotOvertakeAQueuedState` ("A ended on workspace 3 before the marker, the session is on 2") | **caught**, 50 of 50 runs |
| The forward is not checked against what was delivered | n/a, injected, cuts the check | `deliverPush` skips the change count check and always sends to the peers | both tests above, with the same messages | **caught**, 50 of 50 runs each; `TestReconcileReplyDoesNotOvertakeAQueuedState` passes, because the queue alone orders the reply |
| The reconcile reply was dropped for good: a peer forward the fingerprint suppressed counted as delivered, and the reply was no newer | n/a, injected | `deliverPush` drops a snapshot no newer than what was delivered whether or not it carries a reply, with no second snapshot (the first version of this change) | `TestReconcileReplySurvivesASuppressedForward` ("A's push was reconciled, and A read no state that counts it before the next change") | **caught**, 50 of 50 runs; 0 of 50 with the fix. It passes with the whole change removed, because main writes the reply before the forward and never checks it |
| The reconcile reply overtook an older state queued to the same client, which adopted the older state last | n/a, injected, cuts the call site | `handleUpdateState` writes the reply with `sendMessage` before `deliverPush` again, and passes no `toSender` | `TestReconcileReplyDoesNotOvertakeAQueuedState` ("A ended on workspace 3 before the marker, the session is on 2 (states in order: [2 1 3 2])") | **caught**, 50 of 50 runs; 0 of 50 with the fix |

## Why the two-client chrome test catches nothing

Since the rail became session state, a current second client shows the rail
with the first, so the test runs its second client with
`TUIOS_SIDEBAR_LEGACY=1`, as a build from before that. Chrome that differs
between two clients is still possible against an older client, and the test
still guards that case.

`TestOneClientsRailDoesNotMoveAnotherClientsPanes` was written expecting to fail
with the agreed layout reserve removed, and it does not. It is kept as a
deliberate passes-both-ways control, and the reason is worth having written
down, because it says what this harness can and cannot see about multi-client
layout.

With the reserve removed, the two clients still reach the same frame, by
fighting to it. The client with the rail reads the other's rectangles as a
layout for somebody else's screen, works out its own and pushes it; the client
without one reads what comes back as settled, because a layout that sits inside
a wider box and still reaches its far edges cannot be told from one that belongs
there. So the wider client always yields and the frames converge.

What that convergence costs is not on the grid: each round trip resizes the
shared PTYs twice, once to the pushed rectangles and once back. That is what
damages scrollback, and it was counted rather than looked at by two
`internal/app` unit tests, which failed with the reserve removed (four resizes
per pane switch, and the two clients running the same shells at different
sizes). Both have since been removed; `TestSessionHoldsOneSizeForTwoClients`,
`TestGeometryConfigDisagreementDoesNotMovePanes` and the `internal/app`
convergence harness (`TestMultiClientConvergence`) now cover two clients
agreeing on pane sizes, and the reserve-removed mutation has not been rerun
against them. The frame test guards the property a resize count cannot see:
that what the two people are looking at is the same layout. It would catch a change that bought
the resizes back by letting the frames drift apart.

## The two mouse controls that were invisible until the helpers were fixed

Both rows marked "invisible before this change" were measured, not reasoned
about. The procedure for each: build a binary with the fault, run the **old**
helpers against it (the `origin/main` copy of `e2e/tui`), then the **new** ones.

```sh
git worktree add --detach /tmp/negctl origin/main
# inject one fault in /tmp/negctl, then
(cd /tmp/negctl && go build -o /tmp/tuios-fault ./cmd/tuios)

# old helpers
cd /tmp/negctl/e2e/tui && TUIOS_E2E=1 TUIOS_E2E_BIN=/tmp/tuios-fault go test -count=1 -run '<tests>' .
# new helpers
cd e2e/tui           && TUIOS_E2E=1 TUIOS_E2E_BIN=/tmp/tuios-fault go test -count=1 -run '<tests>' .
```

**Eager clipboard copy.** Old helpers: `TestDoubleClickCopiesAWordAndTripleClickTheLine`
and `TestDragSelectionCopiesOnRelease` both PASS. New helpers: the multi-click
test FAILS on the stray write. `clickAt` used to send n presses and one trailing
release, so the release that follows the first click of a gesture was never
generated and nothing that happens on it could be observed; and
`waitForClipboard` asked only whether the wanted text was somewhere in the list
of writes, which cannot see a write that should not be there. The gesture now
asserts its whole sequence of writes: none for a single click, one for a double,
two for a triple, because a triple passes through the word on its way to the
line and each release is a real release.

**A click that freezes every pane.** Old helpers: all thirteen mouse and
context-menu tests PASS. New helpers: `TestClickInPaneDoesNotFreezeOutput`
FAILS, waiting the full 20s for output that never arrives. `leftClick` and
`shiftRightClick` sent a press and no release at all, and a left press inside a
pane sets `OS.Dragging`, which makes `app.updateTerminals` return early: while
it is set tuios stops polling every pane. Sending this test's click press-only
against a *correct* binary reproduces the same 20s timeout, which is the
measurement that the old shape was not a smaller version of a real gesture but a
state no user can reach.

## The ssh fallback tests failed on every Mac, and the cause was pgrep

`TestAttachOnAHostWithSSHFindsTuiosOutsideThePath` and
`TestAttachOnAHostWithSSHRunsTheFarTuios` passed on linux CI and failed on
every macOS run with "--ssh did not run the tuios found at ...". The product
was working: both tests had already seen the far tuios draw the session, and
failed only on the check after it, which proves which program drew it.

That check ran `pgrep -af PATTERN` and searched the output for a command line.
On linux (procps) `-a` means "print the full command line". On macOS and the
BSDs `-a` means "include the ancestors of each match", and pgrep prints bare
pids unless it is also given `-l`. So on a Mac the output held numbers and
nothing else, the positive assertions in those two tests could never pass, and
the negative assertion in `noNestedClient` (`host_attach_test.go`) could never
fail. The last one is the worse half: `TestAttachOnAHostIsDrawnByThisClient`
guards against a nested client and, on a Mac, would have let one through.

The three call sites now use `commandLinesContaining` in `harness_test.go`,
which reads `ps -A -ww -o args=`. That prints every process's untruncated
command line on both systems. The three rows above were run on macOS against
the fixed helper; each also passes on the unmodified build.

## The agent switch, `[agents] enabled = false`

`agents_off_test.go` was run against a build of origin/main, which has no
switch, and against this branch with one call site cut at a time.

| Control | How | Tests that fail | Verdict |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| No switch at all | build origin/main and point `TUIOS_E2E_BIN` at it | `TestAgentsOffShowsNoAgentRow/off` (the rail lists the fake agent), `TestAgentsOffRefusesAgentCommands` (every command succeeds and start-agent opens a pane), `TestAgentsOffRespondGrantStillHolds` (A answers B's prompt), `TestAgentsSwitchAppliesOnReload` (the agents section stays) | **caught** (4 of 4) |
| Strict typing rule | `typingRefusal`: the `agentsOff` branch made `if false` | `TestAgentsOffRespondGrantStillHolds` (RESP_EXIT=0 and ANSWERED:y without respond) | **caught** |
| Verb refusal | `admitVerb`: the `agentsOffRefusal` call cut | `TestAgentsOffRefusesAgentCommands` (list-attention and send-agent-message succeed, no `agents_disabled`) | **caught** |
| Reload | `applyUserConfig`: the `SetAgentsEnabled` call cut | `TestAgentsSwitchAppliesOnReload` (get-agent-state still served after the switch went off) | **caught** |
| Detection tick | `agentMonitor`: the `agentsOff` skip cut | `TestAgentsOffShowsNoAgentRow/off` (the pane holds `working`) | **caught** |
| Client rail gate | `sidebarAgents`: the `agentsOn` term cut | none | **not caught** |
| Queue drop | `clearAgentsForOff`: the `dropAllQueued` call cut | `TestAgentsOffDropsTheQueue` (the message queued before the switch is typed after it) | **caught** |
| Inbox watcher after a start with the switch off | `applyAgentsSwitch`: start the watcher only when the switch moved | `TestAgentsOnAfterStartingOffStartsTheInbox` (the Inbox never shows the other session's prompt) | **caught** |
| Typing into a pane the caller opened | `typingRefusal`: the `offTypingAllowed` term cut | `TestAgentsOffTmuxShimTypesIntoItsOwnPane` (the shim's send-keys is refused) | **caught** |
| The switch is the person's | `verbSetOption`: the pane check made `if false` | `TestAgentsSwitchIsThePersons` (the pane's set-config exits 0) | **caught** |
| This machine's switch on a call to another | `VerbClient.CallWithTimeout`: the `HostCallGuard` check made `if false` | `TestAgentsOffHereRefusesACallToAnotherMachine` (list-agents on build:far succeeds) | **caught** |
| Agent keys in the help | `HelpCategories`: the `withoutAgentHelp` call cut | `TestAgentsOffShowsNoAgentRow/off` (the help search finds "Open the Inbox on its mail") | **caught** |
| Another machine's agent marks | `withHostGroups`: the `clearAgentMarks` call cut | `TestAgentsOffHidesAnotherMachinesAgentMarks` (the mark stays on build's row) | **caught** |
| get-config reads the switch | `verbGetOption`: the `agents.enabled` branch cut | `TestAgentsOffGetConfigSaysOff` (prints `true` with source `default` while every agent verb is refused) | **caught** |

Two fixes have no end-to-end test. Each closes a race that a test cannot
time:
- A `request-approval` admitted just before the switch goes off now closes
  its own hold.
- A detection pass that read the switch before it went off clears what it
  wrote.

The section editor and the length of the notice have no test.

The client rail gate is not caught because the daemon reads the same file
and holds no agent state, so the rail has nothing to list either way. The
gate matters only for a client whose config differs from its daemon's, which
this suite does not set up.

## max_fps up to 240, and auto

Each control cut one line, built the binary, and ran `TestMaxFPS` (the frame
rate test with `TUIOS_E2E_PERF=1`).

| Wiring | Cut | Tests that fail | Verdict |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| The cap | `MaxFPSCap` back to 120 | `TestMaxFPSLoadsAndShows` (list-options says 120, the row never shows 240), `TestMaxFPSAutoReadsTheDisplay` (the row never shows `Auto (144)`) | **caught** |
| Detection at startup | `BindProgram`: the `detectDisplayRate` call cut | `TestMaxFPSAutoReadsTheDisplay` (the row never shows `Auto (144)`) | **caught** |
| The answer reaching the model | `Update`: the `displayRateMsg` case cut | `TestMaxFPSAutoReadsTheDisplay` | **caught** |
| No detection over SSH | `Detect`: the `Local` check cut | `TestMaxFPSAutoReadsTheDisplay` (the SSH client shows `Auto (144)`, not `Auto (60)`; the local client is the positive half) | **caught** |
| Binding the attached client | `session_commands.go`: the `BindProgram` call cut | `TestMaxFPSAutoReadsTheDisplay` | **caught** |
| A save writes a number bare and auto quoted | `MarshalUserConfig`: `EnableMarshalerInterface` cut | `TestMaxFPSLoadsAndShows` (the file never has `max_fps = 240`) | **caught** |
| The detected rate reaching the ticker | `handleDisplayRate`: the `applyFrameRate` call cut | `TestMaxFPS240DrawsPastTheOldClamp` (auto on a 240 Hz display draws 60 frames a second) | **caught** |
| The 120 clamp lifted | build origin/main and point `TUIOS_E2E_BIN` at it | `TestMaxFPS240DrawsPastTheOldClamp` (max_fps 240 draws 120 frames a second) | **caught** |

The frame rate test needs a machine that composes a frame in well under 4 ms,
so it runs only with `TUIOS_E2E_PERF` set. The served-client gate in
`detectsDisplay` (`ClientLocal`) has no control: the suite cannot run an SSH
server client next to a desktop.

## wait-for window-output slowed a flooding pane

A pending `wait-for window-output` captured the whole scrollback on every
output event. A flooding pane raises one event per PTY read. The perf budget
for this is a unit test in `internal/session`, because it times the daemon's
emulator and not a client. It runs the same flood with and without a waiter
in one fixture, so the run without the waiter is its positive half.

| Control | How | Tests that fail | Verdict |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A capture per output event | `waitWindowOutput` in `internal/session/verb_subscribe.go`: the `waitOutputMinGap` coalescing cut, so the `sub.ch` case calls `matches()` on every event | `TestWaitForOutputDoesNotSlowFlood` ("a pending wait-for made the flood 3.37x slower", then 3.27x and 3.57x, against 0.92x to 0.98x with the fix) | **caught in `internal/session`** (3 of 3 run) |

## The tmux shim: prefixes, formats and the commands tools send

Each test in `tmux_shim_compat_test.go` writes the `tuios tmux` calls it made
and their output to `transcript.txt` in its artifact directory. The bug
fixes were cut at their call sites, one build each. The new commands were
checked against origin/main (a640011), which answers each of them with
`unknown command`.

| Control | How | Tests that fail | Verdict |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| No change at all | build origin/main and point `TUIOS_E2E_BIN` at it | all nine `TestTmuxShim*` tests in the file: `show-option`, `wait-for`, `run-shell`, `show-buffer`, `last-pane` and `display-popup` are unknown commands, `pane_pid` is empty, `select-pane -L` needs a client, and the control client answers for `e2e-ctrlp` | **caught** (9 of 9) |
| Command prefixes | `lookupCommand`: a name matches only when it is the whole word | `TestTmuxShimCommandPrefixes` (`unknown command: show-option`) | **caught** |
| pane_pid and pane_tty | `addOnePaneMeta`: the `pid` and `tty` lines cut | `TestTmuxShimPaneFormats` (`pane_pid = ""`) | **caught** |
| history-limit printed `""` | `historyLimit`: the string case cut and `""` returned when the daemon does not say, as before | `TestTmuxShimPaneFormats` (`history-limit = ""`) | **caught** |
| select-pane direction on a detached session, and from the target | `selectPane`: the `selectDirection` call replaced by the old `focus-window` direction call | `TestTmuxShimMovesPanes` (needs an attached client), `TestTmuxShimSelectPaneDirection` (`no window right of the focused one`) | **caught** (2 of 2) |
| Control mode used the wrong session | `runControl`: the `s.attached = c.session` line cut | `TestTmuxShimControlModeTargetsItsSession` (answers for `e2e-ctrlp`) | **caught** |
| set-environment reaches new panes | `splitWindow`: `paneEnvFor` cut from the pane's environment | `TestTmuxShimBuffersAndEnvironment` (the pane sees `/`) | **caught** |

`TestExpandMatchesTmux` in `internal/tmuxcompat` is the wire-compatibility
table for the format language: every expected string is what tmux 3.4
printed for the same format and values. It has no e2e counterpart.

## Pane input encoding: mouse forms, modifyOtherKeys, kitty flags per screen

Each control removed one fix from the current tree, built the binary, and ran
the named test, standalone and against a daemon. Each test has a positive
half in the same fixture: the SGR step for the mouse forms, the plain and
kitty steps for modifyOtherKeys, and the main-screen step for the kitty flags.

| Fix | Cut | Tests that fail | Verdict |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Mouse reports in the X10, UTF-8 (1005) and urxvt (1015) forms | `mouseReport.encode` in `internal/vt/mouse_encode.go`: every non-SGR encoding sent through the old `ansi.MouseX10` call | `TestPaneMouseReportEncoding/standalone` and `/daemon`: the x10 step reads column 101 as UTF-8 and column 231 as BEL, the utf8 and urxvt steps read the X10 form. The sgr step passes | **caught** (2 of 2 run) |
| modifyOtherKeys reaching the pane | `paneKeyBytes` in `internal/input/pane_key.go`: the `EncodeModifyOtherKeys` call cut | `TestPaneModifyOtherKeys/standalone` and `/daemon`: the level1 and level2 steps read the legacy bytes. The plain and kitty steps pass | **caught** (2 of 2 run) |
| A kitty flag stack for each screen | `setAltScreenMode` in `internal/vt/csi_mode.go`: the `SetAltScreen` call cut | `TestPaneKittyFlagsPerScreen/standalone` and `/daemon`: the alt step reads `CSI 97 ; 5 u`. The main step passes | **caught** (2 of 2 run) |
| modifyOtherKeys turned off while the pane is hidden | `ApplyTerminalState` in `internal/session/session.go`: the `ModifyOtherKeysKnown` term cut, so only a level above 0 is restored | `TestPaneModifyOtherKeysOffWhileHidden`: the pane reads `CSI 27 ; 5 ; 97 ~`, want `0x01`. `TestPaneKittyMainStackAcrossAttach` passes | **caught** (1 of 1 run) |
| The main screen's kitty stack across an attach under the alternate screen | `ApplyTerminalState` in `internal/session/session.go`: the `RestoreKittyKeyboardMainStack` call cut | `TestPaneKittyMainStackAcrossAttach`: the pane reads `0x01`, want `CSI 97 ; 5 u`. `TestPaneModifyOtherKeysOffWhileHidden` passes | **caught** (1 of 1 run) |
| The 1005 form writes a button of 128 or more (back, forward) as UTF-8, as xterm does | `mouseReport.encode` in `internal/vt/mouse_encode.go`: the button written as one raw byte again | unit `TestConform_MouseEncoding` ("UTF-8 form, the back button is UTF-8" and "forward with ctrl"). The X10 back button case passes, its positive half | **caught in `internal/vt`** |

## Turn checkpoints and undo

Each test in `checkpoint_test.go` writes the `tuios` calls it made and their
output to `transcript.txt` in its artifact directory. Each control cut one
call site from the current tree, built a binary, and ran the named test
against it.

| Control | How | Tests that fail | Verdict |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| No checkpoint at the end of a turn | the session event sink: the `noteCheckpointEvent` call cut | `TestCheckpointUndoesATurn` ("after turn 1 the pane has 0 checkpoints, want 1") | **caught** |
| No safety checkpoint before a restore | `verbRestoreCheckpoint`: the safety `SaveCheckpoint` call replaced by the newest checkpoint | `TestCheckpointUndoesATurn` (the restore names checkpoint 2 as the undo, and the list has no safety checkpoint 3) | **caught** |
| The restore uses the person's index | `RestoreTree`: the temporary `GIT_INDEX_FILE` dropped from `read-tree` and `checkout-index` | `TestCheckpointUndoesATurn` (the index holds `notes.txt` after the restore) | **caught** |
| A removed worktree keeps its checkpoints | `verbRemoveWorktree`: the `dropCheckpointsOf` call cut | `TestCheckpointsGoWithTheirWorktree` (both refs are still there) | **caught** |
| A restore writes over an ignored file | `RestoreTree`: the `blockingPath` check absent (the tree before the fix) | `TestCheckpointRestoreKeepsIgnoredFiles` (the restore succeeds, and `.env` holds turn 1's text) | **caught** |
| A refused restore keeps its safety checkpoint | `verbRestoreCheckpoint`: the `DeleteCheckpoints` call cut from the `OverwriteError` refusal | `TestCheckpointRestoreKeepsIgnoredFiles` (the list holds a safety checkpoint 3 after a refusal that says nothing was changed) | **caught** |
| A large untracked file in a checkpoint | `SaveCheckpoint`: snapshots with no exclusions and records nothing left out (the tree before the change) | `TestCheckpointLeavesOutLargeUntrackedFiles` (the 2 MiB file is in the diff and the object store, and the list names nothing) | **caught** |

The positive halves are in the same tests: the refused restore while the
agent works runs after restores that succeed, and the main checkout's
checkpoint stays after the worktree's goes. The pruning to `keep` and the
refusal of a checkpoint taken in another work tree have no end-to-end test.

## Copy-mode search columns in the scrollback

Copy-mode search now reads the history as text cells and takes a match's
columns from the cells. It used to count runes as columns, so a cell of
several runes before a match moved the cursor right of it. The ASCII needle
in the same fixture is the positive half: the column check passes on both
builds for a line of one rune a cell. The memory budgets for the search and
for the history save are unit tests in `internal/input` and
`internal/session`, because they measure bytes and not a screen.

| Control | How | Tests that fail | Verdict |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Search columns counted in runes | whole change: build the tree before it and point `TUIOS_E2E_BIN` at it | `TestCopyModeSearchColumnInScrollback` ("needle-cm: the copy cursor is at row 10 column 40, want the match's column 36"); the `needle-ascii` half passes | **caught** |
| A search key decoded every history line | whole change, same build | unit `TestCopyModeSearchKeyBudget` ("one search key allocated 258.1 MB, the budget is 4 MB") | **caught in `internal/input`** |
| A history save decoded its rows under the pane's lock | whole change, same build | unit `TestHistoryCaptureBudget` ("the capture allocated 24.7 MB under the pane's lock, the budget is 4 MB") | **caught in `internal/session`** |
| The line cache bounded by its line count only | whole change, same build | unit `TestScrollbackCacheIsBounded` ("cache holds 102400 decoded cells after a walk of a 400-column ring, want at most 65536") | **caught in `internal/vt`** |

## Push notifications for the Inbox, `[notify]`

Each control cut one call site from the current tree, built the binary, and
ran `TestNotify` (the four tests in `notify_test.go`). The fake provider is
an HTTP server in the test process that stands in for ntfy, Pushover and a
webhook. Each test has its positive half in the same fixture: the first test
proves the line changed (`list-attention` shows the new line) before it counts
that nothing more was sent, the quiet test sends an approval after the client
left, and the held test sends the held approval itself.

`TestNotifyPushesAnApprovalNobodyIsLookingAt` sets `cooldown_seconds = 0`.
With the default cooldown of 60 seconds, the de-dupe control passed: the
cooldown for the same pane and kind held back the second send on its own, so
the test did not reach the per-item check it names. With no cooldown the
per-item check is the only thing in the way, and the control fails.

Its positive half is the browser with no cookie, which shows no Inbox | **caught** |
| Notifications need no curl | whole change: build the tree with the curl `internal/pushnotify/send.go` and `pushnotify.go` and point `TUIOS_E2E_BIN` at it | `TestNotifyNeedsNoCurl` ("after the approval, with no curl: want 1 request per provider, got ntfy 0, pushover 0, webhook 0"). The other three `TestNotify` tests pass on that build, since curl is on PATH for them. Positive half: the same test passes on the net/http build | **caught** |

The test of a secret in the daemon log reads `daemon.log` at
`TUIOS_LOG_LEVEL=trace` and first checks that the log records the ntfy send,
so a log that is empty or in another place fails it. No control injects a
secret into the log. `TestNotifySecretsStayOutOfDumps` in `internal/config`
is the unit test of the redaction itself. It caught a real leak while it was
written: fmt prints a pointer field with `%s` or `%q` through its error path,
which skips `String` and `Format`, so a token in `[notify.ntfy]` printed whole.
The provider tables now format themselves.

## Shipping a worktree: commit, merge, push, pull request

The tests in `ship_test.go` use a throwaway repository with a bare
repository as its origin, a fake `gh` on `PATH` that records its arguments
and answers with canned JSON, and a fake `gpg` that signs anything. Each
writes its `tuios` calls to `transcript.txt`, and the main test writes the
fake `gh`'s calls to `gh-calls.txt`. Each control cut one line from the
current tree, built a binary, and ran the named test against it.

| Control | How | Tests that fail | Verdict |

| `fan keep --merge` that does not merge | `verbKeepFan`: the `if p.Merge` block made false | `TestFanKeepMergesTheKeptAttempt` (the keep into a dirty main checkout is not refused) | **caught** |

The positive halves are in the same tests: the commit refused while the
agent works is followed by one that succeeds, the push refused without a
confirmation is followed by one with `--yes` that reaches the origin, the
conflicting and dirty merges follow a fast-forward that lands, and the
refused keep is followed by one that merges. A push that is not a
fast-forward, a squash or ff-only merge, a pull request that is already
open, and gh missing or not logged in have no end-to-end test.

## The way out of the spotlight

People who turned the spotlight on by mistake saw a short message and then a
dimmed screen with no way out on it. The dock now shows a Spotlight chip with
the key that turns it off. Esc turns it off in window mode. In terminal mode
esc stays with the program, and leader, B turns it off. A click on the chip
turns it off in any mode. The window-mode key moved from `b` to `B`.

All seven tests in `spotlight_exit_test.go` fail on origin/main at b0cd61cb,
because that build draws no chip. For `TestEscReachesTheProgramWhileTheSpotlightIsOn`
that failure is only the positive half: esc already reached the pane there. The
injected controls below change one call site each from the current tree, built the
binary, and ran the named tests.

## Mode legends in the dock, and messages cut at a word

Hints mode said its keys in a message, and the dock cut it in the middle of a
word: at 80 columns the base build shows `Type a label to copy. Shift+labe…`,
and once the message burnt down the dock showed no keys at all while hints
mode stayed open. Copy mode, multi copy mode and hints mode now show a legend
in the dock, fitted by whole keys. Each control cut one call site from the
current tree in a copy of it, built the binary, and ran the named tests. The
positive half of the fitting control is the 200-column run, which passes on
the broken build because the whole legend fits there. The positive half of the
word-cut control is the 80 and 81 column runs, where a cut by width falls on a
word boundary by chance and passes.

Copy mode also said its keys in a message ("Copy mode (hjkl, q to exit)"),
which held the dock's right end over the legend for twice the message time.
No control is recorded for its removal. The legend tests wait up to the UI
timeout, which is longer than the message lasts, so they pass with it put back.
Five tests waited for that message as the sign that copy mode opened, and now
wait for `y yank` in the legend. Two of them, `TestScrollbackModeShowsEarlierOutput`
and `TestSessionSwitchKeepsScrollback`, were missed at first and failed on
every run of the whole suite until they were changed too.

## Opening links, OSC 8 in the frame, and the URL detector

Each control cut one call site from the current tree, built the binary, and
ran the named test against it. The opener in these tests is a script set
through `appearance.link_opener` that appends its argument to a file, so a
link that opened is a line in that file and a link that was refused is none.
The positive halves are in the same fixtures: the refused file and script
links come before a shift+click that must open, the `link_click = "ctrl"`
test ends with a ctrl+click that must open, and the markdown test copies a
Wikipedia URL that keeps its brackets.

## The session-list poll tick composes no frame

The poll tick stopped composing a frame to save idle CPU. The rail draws
other sessions from the listing the tick's refresh fetches, and that refresh
answered with no message, so a change in another session reached the screen
only when something else drew a frame. The refresh now answers with
`foreignSessionsChangedMsg` when the listing changed. The control is the
tree with the tick change and without that message.

## A loaded layout shows its shells (#411)

subscribed a pane that arrived that way.

## The scratch group before a daemon restart

`TestScratchGroupSurvivesADaemonRestart` typed into the scratch group as soon
as it pressed the scratch key. The group opens through the daemon, so the
text could reach the pane that had the focus before. The hide then left that
marker on screen, and the test failed (main, run 37025035958). The test now
waits for each pane of the group before it types.

With the waits: passes with the sleep, and 10 of 10 without it | **caught** |

## Back from an empty workspace (discussion #273)

The tests are in `empty_workspace_test.go`. Each control built the binary and
ran the five `TestEmptyWorkspace` tests or the one named.

`TestEmptyWorkspaceStaysWhenTheSettingIsOff` passes on origin/main, because
it holds the old behaviour.

`TestEmptyWorkspaceReturnsAfterXpanesSpeedy` then failed in five main runs in
a row (37232733943 to 37243024125), with two panes left after Enter. The
daemon sent xpanes's `SetMultifocus` to the first client its map gave, which
was the second client about half the time. Multifocus is the client's own, so
Enter at the client that ran xpanes reached one pane. `findTUIClient` now
takes the client the person used last.

With the fix: 30 of 30 pass | **caught** |

## CLI output for scripts, and names that do not exist

build made both cuts. Each assertion reads one of them.

checks every action and default key on Linux and on macOS. It catches the
same two cuts.

The positive halves are in the same tests: `--types window-created` streams
the event of a new window, and `keep` is still listed after `build` closes.

## Tapes: actions, condition waits, failures and recording

The tests are in `tape_exec_test.go`. Each control is its own build, made by
cutting one call site from the tree the tests were written against.

control of its own: it fails on any of the first two cuts, since the example
uses both.

## herdr plugins

`TestHerdrPluginTrustAndHooks`, `TestHerdrPluginActions`,
`TestHerdrPluginPanes` and `TestHerdrPluginPalette` run the stand-in plugins in
`testdata/herdrplugins`. Each control cut one line in a shared clone of the
branch, built the binary, and ran the one test named.

person enables it.

`TestSendKeysEncodesKeysForThePaneMode` in `send_keys_encoding_test.go` sends

## The opt-in explorers: help -i, config browse, keybinds browse

`explorers_test.go` saves each frame it checks as text and PNG. Each control
cut one call site from the branch, built a binary, and ran the named test.

| Control | How | Tests that fail | Verdict |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| help -i does nothing | the help command's `Run`: the `!interactive` term cut, so -i prints the plain help | `TestHelpExplorer` (the child exits 0 before the explorer's title shows) | **caught** |
| help opens an explorer on a terminal | the help command's `Run`: the plain branch also made to need a stdout that is not a terminal | `TestHelpExplorer` (`tuios help` on a terminal never exits by itself) | **caught** |
| config browse does not set | the explorer's `Apply`: the `setConfigOption` call cut | `TestConfigExplorer` (no refusal for `sideways`, and the source never reads `session`) | **caught** |
| keybinds browse is not wired | `addExplorers`: the keybinds `AddCommand` cut | `TestKeybindsExplorer` (the child prints the keybinds help and exits) | **caught** |

The positive halves: each test leaves its explorer with `q`, and
`TestExplorerEscLeaves` with `esc`, and both wait for the process to exit by
itself with status 0. The "plain on a terminal" checks run `tuios help`,
`tuios help checkpoint`, `tuios config`, `tuios list-options`, `tuios keybinds`
and `tuios keybinds list` in a terminal and check that each exits by itself,
never shows the alternate screen, and ends with the lines it prints with no
terminal.
## A close_on_exit window outlived a command that exited at once

`new-window` with `close_on_exit` closes the window from the process's exit
callback, which finds the window by its PTY. A command that exited before
the window was in the state left the callback nothing to find, and the
window stayed. The control is a unit test in `internal/session`, because it
must hold the add until the process has exited, and only a test hook can
order the two. The callback runs in the same fixture, so its finding the
window is the positive half.

## A trim timer reset from outside its synctest bubble

`internal/memtrim` kept one trim timer and reset it on each `Request`. A
window closed inside a synctest bubble armed that timer in the bubble. The
next `Request`, from an ordinary test cleanup, reset it from outside, and the
runtime ended the test binary. Each `Request` now starts its own timer.

## The newest paste buffer lost a tie on mtime

The tmux shim ordered paste buffers by their file's mtime. Two buffers
written in one tick of the kernel's file clock tied, and the name order
picked the top. `paste-buffer` with no `-b` then typed the older buffer.
`writeBuffer` now stamps each buffer after the newest one.

| Control | How | Tests that fail | Verdict |

## tuios hosts sync

`TestHostsSync` syncs four fake hosts: one with no tuios, one with the new
version, one with the old version and a daemon that runs `sleep` in a pane,
and one with no machine behind its address. `TestHostsSyncRestartWithYes`
restarts the daemon of an old host. Each control changed one line, built the
binary, and ran the named test.

| Wiring | Cut | Tests that fail | Verdict |

| The dry run | `runHostsSync`: the `!opts.dryRun` gate on the apply step made `true` | `TestHostsSync` ("the dry run changed a binary on a host") | **caught** |
| A matching version is left alone | `planSyncTarget`: `t.install` made always true | `TestHostsSync` (same plans "would update" and is installed again) | **caught** |
| One failed host does not stop the rest | injected: return an error after the probe when one host failed | `TestHostsSync` (no result for any host) | **caught** |
| The restart | `planSyncTarget`: `t.restart = true` made `false` | `TestHostsSyncRestartWithYes` (the daemon still runs the old version) | **caught** |
| The busy panes | `readDaemonSessions`: the `parsePaneProcs` call cut | `TestHostsSync` (no busy pane, and the refusal does not name `sleep`) | **caught** |

The first CI run of `TestHostsSync` read the plan right after it made the pane
that runs `sleep`, and found no busy pane (run 37232323815). The pane was not
yet running `sleep`. The test now reads the plan again, for up to 20 seconds,
until the pane shows. The busy-pane control still fails after that wait.

## --start on tuios hosts test and tuios hosts sync

`TestHostsTestStart` tests a fake host that has tuios and no daemon.
`TestHostsSyncStart` tests a fake host with no tuios. `TestHostsSync` also
checks that a restart counts one session as "1 session". Each control ran
the named tests against one build.

## A pending wait-for and a flood of output

`TestWaitForOutputDoesNotSlowFlood` in `internal/session` compared the wall
time of a flood with a pending waiter against one without it. On shared CI
runners that ratio failed at 2.76x and 2.83x (runs 37241456414 and
37246926645), and it was 1.00x to 1.12x locally on one core and on eight.
The load on a runner changes between the two floods, so the ratio measured
the runner. The test now counts what the waiter does during the flood: its
captures, and how long they hold the emulator lock.

| Control | How | Tests that fail | Verdict |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A capture on every output event | `waitOutputMinGap` set to 0 in `internal/session/verb_subscribe.go` | `TestWaitForOutputDoesNotSlowFlood` ("the waiter took 1554 captures in 983ms, more than the 26 its gap allows"), 10 of 10 runs | **caught in `internal/session`** |

With the fix the waiter took 7 to 27 captures, and held the lock for 1% to 2%
of the flood on the pure Go backend and 12% on libghostty-vt. 30 of 30 runs
passed on one core, and 5 of 5 with `-tags ghostty`.

## The tape FAILED indicator, looked for after it went away

`TestTapeExecStopsAtTheFailedLine` failed on CI (run 37255241424, shard 3 of
6) with "the client never showed that the tape failed". The client shows
FAILED for `scriptDoneLinger` (2s) after a tape stops, and the first frame
drawn after that drops it. The test slept 2s before it looked, so any frame
drawn in between, such as a notification's, hid the indicator. The test now
looks for FAILED as soon as exec returns, before the sleep.

| Control | How | Tests that fail | Verdict |

## The looks pin and a config save in flight

`TestChromeSetFromTheCommandLineRetilesThePanes` failed in CI on 2 and 3
October with "a pane is at row 0 and 38 rows tall" and the rail at column 28.
That is the dock at the bottom row and the rail of the pinned looks. The
harness pins the looks on every CLI call, and the call reads and rewrites the
config file. Before `e57ecf37` a save truncated the file and then wrote it. A
pin that read the empty file wrote back a file of pins alone after the save
ended, and the client's watcher applied it. `e57ecf37` closed the empty read.
The harness now leaves alone a file it has pinned once and that tuios wrote
since, and it writes through a rename. The test also checks the rows after
the rail step, where the rewrite went unseen before.

Both injections below make the two windows wide enough to hit every time. The
product one is on `e57ecf37~1`: `writeConfigBytes` opens the file with
`O_TRUNC`, sleeps, and then writes. The harness one: a pin that reads an empty
file sleeps 1.2 s before it writes. Without them the race did not show
locally: 30 of 30 runs passed on main on 2 cores, and 30 of 30 on
`e57ecf37~1` on 1 core with a busy loop beside it. No CI run of this test
failed after `e57ecf37`. With this change, 30 of 30 runs pass on main on 2
cores.

The pin read the empty file in 10 of 10 runs | **caught** (10 of 10) |
| The same, with the harness fix | as above, the new harness | none. The pin read the empty file in 10 of 10 runs and left it alone | **passes** (10 of 10), the positive half |

## What this harness structurally cannot observe

Some things cannot be simulated from here at all. They are listed so that nobody
writes a helper for them, watches it pass, and believes it.

**Pointer motion outside a drag.** `app.ProgramOptions` (internal/app/program_options.go), which every client runs with, installs
`tea.WithFilter(app.FilterMouseMotion)`, a whitelist that discards every
`tea.MouseMotionMsg` unless a window drag, a window resize, an overlay drag, the
scrollback browser, or a pane running a mouse-tracking application is active. In
any other state the model never receives motion, so hover behaviour is not
merely untested here, it is unobservable: a helper that sends motion and an
assertion on its effect would be asserting on an event the shipping binary
throws away. This is why `mouseHover` carries a warning and is used by exactly
one test, `TestBareMotionReachesAnEventTrackingApp`, which drives the one state
where bare motion does get through. Note in particular that as of this commit
`app.ContextMenuHover` is unreachable in the shipping binary for this reason: an
open context menu is not one of the whitelisted states, so moving the pointer
over a menu row cannot highlight it. If the whitelist gains that state, this
paragraph needs revisiting and hover over a menu becomes testable from here.
Motion *is* delivered during `mouseDrag`, because
the press that opens the drag sets `OS.Dragging` before the first motion report
arrives, so the selection, window-move and resize paths are genuinely covered.

**Chords the user's terminal eats first.** The harness writes bytes into a PTY,
so it can only send what a terminal would send. Anything a real terminal
intercepts before the application sees it, shift+click bindings in kitty being
the usual example, cannot be reproduced here, and neither can the *absence* of
those bytes be distinguished from tuios ignoring them. `TestContextMenuTargets`
asserts that tuios acts on a shift+right-click it receives; whether the user's
terminal will deliver one is outside this suite entirely.

**Typing speed.** `SendKeys` writes a whole string in one `write(2)`, so a
command and its Enter arrive as a single burst that bubbletea parses into
back-to-back key events. That is closer to a paste than to typing. Timing-
sensitive input handling, key repeat coalescing and the insert guard's exact
window are covered by unit tests in `internal/input`, not here.

**Races and narrow timing windows.** See the two rows above about the blank
alt-screen cache and the unlocked emulator resize: the program under test is a
separate process, so `-race` on this package instruments the harness and not
tuios.

## Tests without a specific negative control

`TestScrolledOutputRendersCorrectly`, `TestScrollbackModeShowsEarlierOutput`,
and the interactive-surface tests (`TestWindowCreateAndClose`,
`TestRenameWindow`, `TestFocusCycleWithRapidKeyRepeat`, `TestWorkspaceSwitch`,
`TestMinimizeAndRestore`, `TestZoomToggle`, `TestResizeKeepsPaneContent`,
`TestTwoClientsSeeConsistentState`) are not tied to one commit. They cover
surface that had no test at all. They were written to fail loudly rather than
silently: each waits for content a shell computed, so a frozen or blanked UI
fails on the step it broke instead of passing against a stale screen.

Two of them earned their keep during development by failing against the
*fixed* binary for real reasons, which is documented in the commit history:
`countWindows` originally misread the dock, and the tiling assertion originally
waited on a toast that other toasts push off screen.

The frame check in `TestWideRuneInHistorySurvivesANarrowPane` reads the
pane's border cell, and the last column's background in one layout. It
cannot see a style lost at the edge in every layout, because the frame cuts
an overlong row in a way that depends on the render path. The render test in
`internal/app` is the check for that.

## Dock pill caps off (#451)

`dock_pill_caps = false` left the caps on the mode chip and the workspace
pills. Their cap accessors did not read the setting. The default then became
rounded, so an unset option draws the caps.

## Sessionizer: tuios new --cwd and switch-session (#452)

`tuios new` started the first window in the daemon's directory. No command
switched an attached client, and a session switched to in place ignored
`[startup]`. The tests are in `sessionizer_test.go`.

## Keybindings in a config saved on disk (#358)

`TestAKeybindingSavedOnDiskReachesTheClient` in `config_watch_test.go` binds
`prefix+alt+h` in a saved file and presses it on the running client. The
positive half is in the same test: `prefix+alt+y` from the startup file fires,
and `prefix+alt+h` does nothing before the save.

## Command entries whose made-up names clash

`TestKeybindsDoctorNamesACommandNameClash` in `keybinds_doctor_test.go` writes
two `[[keybindings.command]]` entries with no name, whose commands agree in the
first 40 characters. The positive half is the same two entries with a name
each: the doctor reports nothing and `keybinds list` shows both.

## Compact dock

`dock_compact_test.go` drives `appearance.dock_compact` with the dock at the top

## Session number keys and the workspace rename action

`TestSwitchSessionByNumberAndRenameWorkspace` in `session_number_keys_test.go`
binds `switch_session_3`, `switch_session_9` and `rename_workspace` with three
sessions. The positive half is in the same test: slot 9 is empty and says so,
and the rename leaves the session the client left alone.

## Tailscale SSH check mode and policy refusals

The tests are in `hosts_tailscale_test.go`. A wrapper in front of the sync
stand-in prints the banner real Tailscale prints in check mode, then waits for
an approval file. A second address prints the policy refusal and exits 255.

## Tailscale SSH sign-in on the rail

The tests are in `hosts_signin_test.go`. The rail stand-in (`writeFakeSSH`)
has the Tailscale wrapper of `hosts_tailscale_test.go` in front of it. The link
opener is a script that records each address it gets. `quickbox` ends each
wait after 6 seconds. The tests wait for its fourth dial to end, so the link's
backoff is 16 seconds: a new page within 8 seconds can only come from the
gesture. After that dial the backoff is 32 seconds, and a page within 12
seconds can only come from the quick redial a sign-in starts. `localbox` and
`lookalikebox` print a banner with `http://127.0.0.1:631/admin` and
`https://login.tailscale.com.evil.example/a/...`.

Not covered by an e2e test: the 2 second floor between dials that
`retry-host` can wake (`retryMinGap`), and the address left out of `list-hosts`
and `list-host-sessions` for a caller over a link. The address check itself
also has a table test, `TestSignInURLAllowed` in `internal/federation`.

## Copy sweep after a copy-mode yank

`copy_flash_yank_test.go` samples the frames after a copy-mode yank and holds
the light to the yanked text. `TestCopyFlashSweepsACopyModeYank` covers `y` on
a `v` selection, `y` on a `V` selection through a daemon, and a copy-pipe key.
`TestCopyFlashSweepsAMultiCopyYank` covers `y` in multi copy mode. The positive
half is the mouse copy in `copy_flash_test.go`, which sweeps with the same
config, and the multi copy test also asserts no light on the pane without a
selection.

## last_pane

`last_pane_test.go` walks the focus with the focus-window CLI, presses `;` to
flip back and forth, then repeats the flip after a new pane (`n`) and after a
switch to an empty workspace (`Alt+2`, `n`), where the flip must return to the
pane focus left on workspace one.

## Resizing under shared borders

`shared_border_resize_test.go` resizes panes with shared borders on and reads

divider survived, so a fixture that resizes nothing cannot pass.

## Pane labels (display_panes)

The tests are in `pane_labels_test.go`. They read each label's block glyphs
off the screen with the pane's name under them, type the label, and read the
focused pane back from list-windows. The positive half of each jump is a
check that the focus was on another pane before the label was typed. Esc
closes the labels with no jump in the same test. The leak test sets one known
prompt in every pane and shows first, with the labels closed, that the key
and the paste reach the shells and leave the line it looks for.

## ssh-aware splits

The tests are in `ssh_split_test.go`. A fake ssh on PATH writes its arguments
to a numbered file and then acts as a shell. `TestSSHSplitRunsTheSSHOnPath`
uses a compiled stand-in (`fakessh/`) on PATH and a copy of it in the pane's
folder, run as `./ssh`. The refusal tests (`TestSSHSplitRefusesAProxyCommand`,
`TestSSHSplitIgnoresTheSSHOfATransfer`) have their positive half in
`TestSSHSplitRunsTheSameSSH` and `TestSSHSplitFindsSSHUnderANestedShell`,
which follow ssh through the same fixture. The stand-in answers `ssh -G` with
the host name of `-o HostName`, or the destination, and records nothing.
`TestSSHSplitPassesTheAgentSocket` starts an `ssh-agent` in the pane and
stops it when it ends. The positive half of the follow
option is in its own fixture: the same split key in a pane with no ssh opens a
shell. `TestSSHSplitFallsBackToAShell` is the positive half of every other
test: the actions open a pane when no ssh runs.

## The pane navigator (choose_tree) and list-windows --all

The tests are in `navigator_test.go`. The target pane prints its marker in
two halves, so only its screen text holds the marker whole. The positive half
of the jump is a check that the focus was on another pane first, and Esc
closes the navigator with no switch in the same test. The grant test runs the
same listing from outside every pane first, where it must hold the other
session's text.

### Review fixes for the navigator

`TestNavigatorTakesPastes` sets one known prompt in the shell and shows
first, with the navigator closed, that a paste reaches it. The stale-load,
cap and deadline tests use two seams: `TUIOS_E2E_HOLD_NAV` holds a load
until a file goes, and `TUIOS_E2E_NAV_CAPTURES` lowers the cap to one pane.
The verb client tests are unit tests of the deterministic race kind, in
`internal/session/verb_client_step_test.go`. The listing test is a unit test
of the security boundary kind, in `cmd/tuios/list_every_pane_test.go`.

### A scattered name outranks the screen text

`TestNavigatorLooks` failed in CI when a pane's id and its `t.TempDir`
folder spelled `needle-7781` out of order. Every field hit outranked every
text hit, so that pane took the cursor and the preview from logs. Now both
kinds of hit rank by the same fuzzy score. `TestNavigatorRanksScreenTextOverAScatteredName`
names a pane `need a ledge-77 81` so the case is fixed, not random. Its
positive half is in the same wait: the decoy is listed, so the search matched
it and only the order decides. The control was also run on the pre-fix
build, with the same failure.

| Control | How | Tests that fail | Verdict |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A field hit outranks every text hit | `navigatorSearchRows`: the field hit's score given a lead of `1<<21` | `TestNavigatorRanksScreenTextOverAScatteredName` ("the search for needle-7781 did not put the cursor and the preview on logs") | **caught** |

`TestNavigatorScoresTheWholeOccurrence` prints `navDecoy` and then the marker
on one line. `Find` aligns the query inside the shortest window that ends
first, so it scores the spread copy, which ties the decoy's name, and the
decoy wins the tie. The control frame lists late under the decoy.

### The navigator's look

The tests are in `navigator_preview_test.go`. `TestNavigatorLooks`, in
`navigator_look_test.go`, saves the frames a person looks at and asserts only
that each screen showed. The colour test reads the ink of the marker inside
the preview box only, so the coloured search line and list row cannot pass it.
No theme is on, so the pane's red and green reach the host as palette slots 1
and 2, which the chrome does not use. The inert test reads every byte tuios
wrote to the host, from the start, after the preview shows the pane's text.

kind, for what a daemon that is not tuios could send.

## Agents settings tab and the integration notice

`agents_settings_test.go` uses a temporary home with a Claude Code integration
aged from the current version to the one before, and a stand-in `claude` on
PATH. The positive halves are in the same fixtures: the same frame shows Codex
as not installed, the daemon's `list-agents` is read for the harness on both
panes before the "no second toast" half counts, and
`TestAgentsSettingsTabBeforeTape` is the switch-on twin of
`TestAgentsSettingsHiddenWithAgentsOff`.

### Review fixes

`TestAgentsSettingsKeepsTheCommandPath` installs with `--command` and the full
path of the binary under test, current and aged.
`TestAgentsSettingsAbsentOverSSH` attaches through `tuios ssh` to the same
fixture. Its positive halves are `TestAgentsSettingsTabBeforeTape` (the menu
line and the tab) and `TestAgentsIntegrationNoticeOncePerRun` (the palette),
with a local client. The notice test now also starts a second client before
the dismissal, which shows the toast, and a third after it, which does not.
The race tests in `internal/integration/file_changed_test.go` change the file
just before the last check, through a test hook.

### Second review

shows, checks that nothing was stored, and attaches again: the toast comes
back. It is also the positive half of the stored dismissal, which
`TestAgentsIntegrationNoticeOncePerRun` now makes with a click on the dismiss
end of the toast. `TestInstallNamesWhatAPartialWriteChanged` changes Hermes's
`config.yaml`, the last of its three files, before each rename.

of dismissals on save, the uninstall row for an install with only the MCP
server or the status line left, and the doctor's note for a session whose
hosts it could not read.

## A new session on a host ignores startup.tiled (#480)

`TestRemoteCreateAppliesStartup` in `sessionizer_test.go` uses the second
daemon and the ssh stand-in of the host tests. This client has `[startup]
tiled = true`. The host has no config, so the tiling comes from the config of
the client. From a tiled session, `switch-session --create build:far-new` must
make a tiled session on the host. `tuios new --host build far-fresh` is checked
in the same fixture. It already passed on main, so it is the positive half: the
host and the check of the tiling work.

`TestSwitchToAnEmptySessionTakesItsLayout` in the same file checks the layout
mode. `blank` is master-stack and empty, and `home` is BSP. The client goes
from `home` to `blank` and switches workspace there, which sends its layout to
the daemon. `blank` must stay master-stack. Its positive half is `home`: the
same client reports BSP there.

## A popup that switches the session (#479)

`TestPopupThatSwitchesSessionCloses` in `popup_test.go` opens a popup whose
command runs `tuios switch-session --create away` and exits. The popup must
leave the window list of `home`, where no client is attached when it exits.
Its positive half is in the same fixture: a popup that exits without a switch
leaves the list too.

status. A test-only hook, `popupBeforeWaitHook`, holds the wait until the PTY
is gone, so the order is the same on every run.

`tuios new --cwd`, runs `tuios kill-server`, waits for the new daemon to
restore the session, and opens a window on an empty workspace with
`tuios new-window --workspace 3`. Inheritance is off in the config, and the
only pane moves out of the project first, so the start directory is the only
way the window can land in the project. The daemon runs in `base/cwd`.

### Review fixes

`TestStartDirectoryOutlivesARestartWhileMissing` moves the project folder
away, restarts the daemon (the restore runs with the folder gone), restarts it
again (`kill-server` saves the session first), moves the folder back, restarts
a third time, and opens a window on an empty workspace.

absolute folder already, so only a raw verb call can send a relative one.

## A pane on a switch to an empty workspace (#477)

`new_window_when_empty_test.go` turns on `workspaces.new_window_when_empty`.
`TestEmptyWorkspaceOpensAPane` checks that startup opens no pane, then
switches by key to workspace 2 (one pane, in the folder of the pane it came
from), exits that pane and switches to workspace 5 (one pane, in the
session's start folder), presses `move_and_follow_7` (workspace 7 holds only
the moved pane), runs `tuios xpanes` (its workspace holds two panes), and
switches with `run-command SwitchWorkspace` and `select-workspace` (no pane).
Inheritance is off, so the folder has one way to be chosen.
`TestEmptyWorkspaceOpensOnePaneForTwoClients` switches one of two attached
clients and counts one pane. `TestEmptyWorkspacePaneSettingReloads` switches
with the setting off (no pane), turns it on in the file and switches again
(one pane). Every count waits until the client that took the keys reports
no pane request in flight (`run-command GetSessionInfo`, `pane_requests`), then
counts again. A request clears when a sync brings its pane, so the daemon has
made every pane the client asked for. The two client test asks each client.
The rows below were run again on the reviewed tree, and each fails as listed.

### Review fixes: fast switches

`TestEmptyWorkspaceFastSwitches` sends Alt+2 Alt+1, then Alt+2 Alt+1 Alt+2,
then Alt+2 Alt+3, each as one write. `TUIOS_E2E_HOLD_PANE` makes the daemon
hold each pane request for a second, so the pushes the later keys make queue
behind it. Once no request is in flight it checks the workspace the session
and the client show (1, 2, 3) and the panes on each workspace (one each).

### Second review: one pane per workspace at the daemon

`TUIOS_E2E_HOLD_PANE` now acts only with `TUIOS_E2E=1`, and a file that holds
`refuse` makes the daemon fail the request.
`TestEmptyWorkspaceSlowRequestOpensOnePane` holds the first request for 7 s,
waits 5.5 s, and sends Alt+1 Alt+2, so the client asks again after its 5 s
timeout. `TestEmptyWorkspaceTwoClientsSwitchAtOnce` holds requests for 2 s:
the first client switches to 2, and the second follows, then sends Alt+1
Alt+2, so both clients ask. `TestEmptyWorkspaceFailedRequestKeepsTheSwitch`
refuses the request for Alt+2, presses Alt+1, and waits for the session to
show workspace 1 with no pane on 2. `TestEmptyWorkspacePaneFollowsSSH` turns
on `appearance.new_window_follow_ssh`, runs the fake ssh in the pane on 1,
and switches to 2: the new pane runs the same ssh.

## A session made from the session switcher ignores [startup] tiled (#488)

`TestSwitcherCreateAppliesStartup` in `switcher_create_startup_test.go` sets
`[startup] tiled = true`, opens the session switcher, types `fresh`, a name
no session has, and presses Enter. `fresh` must be tiled, and its first
window must fill the session. The same client then runs the palette's
"New session", which came up tiled on main too: it is the positive half.

## Workspace label cap and tab format

`dock_workspace_label_max_test.go` drives the dock's workspace pill through

## A new window ignores the OSC 7 folder on Windows (#491)

`TestNewWindowInheritsTheOSC7Folder` in `inherit_cwd_osc7_test.go` starts the
daemon with `TUIOS_E2E=1` and `TUIOS_E2E_NO_PROCESS_CWD=1`, which makes every
process read fail, as it does on Windows, and with
`COMPUTERNAME=TUIOS-E2E-PC`. The pane's shell is `/bin/sh`, which reports
nothing, and the test prints each report. The session starts in
`base/start`. From the focused pane each time:

- an OSC 7 report with this machine's host name in capitals: the new window
  must start there. This is the positive half, and main with the hook passes
  it.
- an OSC 7 report with the host `TUIOS-E2E-PC`: the new window must start
  there.
- an OSC 7 report of a folder that does not exist: the new window must start
  in `base/start`.
- an OSC 9;9 report with a quoted path: the new window must start there.

`TestNewWindowPrefersTheShellsProcessFolder` is the review's regression,
with process reads on. A program in a `/bin/sh` pane prints OSC 7 for
`base/fake`, which exists, and the person then runs `cd base/real`. The new
window must start in `base/real`. The daemon holding the report is the
positive half.

`TestPickWindowCwdTrustsAReadableProcess` in the same file pins the second
review's case: the record, which holds the pane's report, is taken only when
no process can be read. A shell whose folder was deleted is readable, and
then the window gets the start folder, not the report.

### The slash in front of the drive (#491, second report)

The reporter's `list-windows` showed the folder `\C:\dev\x` for the report
`file://NOTE238/C:/dev/x`: the URL path keeps a slash in front of the drive.
`winpath.FileURL` is now the one reader of an OSC 7 URL, on the client and in
the daemon, and it drops that slash. `winpath.ForOS` turns the folder into a
path for the daemon's OS, and refuses a drive path on any OS but Windows.

`TestParseCwdOnEachOS` in `internal/session/session_place_test.go` runs the
parser for a Windows daemon and for a Linux one on any OS: the reporter's URL,
`file:///C:/x`, percent escapes, OSC 9;9 in both slashes and quoted, UNC paths,
and reports from another machine. It also passes as a Windows binary under
wine. A UNC report, `file://server/share/x`, is read as the folder `/share/x`
on the machine `server`, because OSC 7 names the machine the shell runs on.

`TestSSHSplitIntoWindowsSendsNoDriveFolder` in `ssh_split_test.go` is the
case Linux can show: the far shell reports `file://fakehost/C:/Users/pollen/my%20app`,
and an ssh split must run plain ssh. Before, it ran `cd "/C:/Users/pollen/my app"`
through `sh`, which a Windows ssh server does not have.
`TestSSHSplitKeepsTheRemoteFolder` is the positive half: a POSIX folder from
the same far machine still gets its `cd`.

| Control | How | Tests that fail | Verdict |

| The drive slash stays in the URL path | `dropDriveSlash`: `return p[1:]` made `return p` | `TestSSHSplitIntoWindowsSendsNoDriveFolder` (ssh ran `cd "/C:/Users/pollen/my app"`), `TestParseCwdOnEachOS` (the far-machine rows read `/C:/dev/x`, and Linux takes `file:///C:/x` as a local folder) | **caught** |

| A UNC folder gets a cd | `safeRemoteDir`: the `//` refusal cut | `TestSSHSplitIntoWindowsSendsNoDriveFolder/unc` (ssh ran `cd "//srv/share"`) | **caught** |

The review's second round added three things. `safeRemoteDir` refuses a
folder that starts with `//`, which is the UNC folder of a Windows shell
(`file://winbox//srv/share`), and the `unc` row of
`TestSSHSplitIntoWindowsSendsNoDriveFolder` covers it. `FileURL` refuses a
path that decodes to a control character (`%00`, `%1b`, `%0a`), and
`TestParseCwdOnEachOS` has rows for those and a positive row for `%C3%A9`.
`hintCwdHost` reads the host with `url.Parse` again, so a report with no
path, `file://far`, still names another machine and still blocks opening a
path here.

Not covered end to end: a real Windows machine. The unit table and the wine run
stand in for it.

## A bare attach picks the session the person used last (#486)

A bare `tuios attach` lands on the session the person used last: the
latest `lastUsed`, then the latest activity. Only `MsgSessionUsed` sets
`lastUsed`. A client sends it for input from the terminal it runs in, at most
once a second per session, and only to a daemon whose welcome set
`SessionUsed`. The daemon takes it only from a client that may act as the
person. Pane input (`MsgInput`) is activity only: a routed `send-keys`, a
tape and a focus report reach the pane that way too. The client reports
input before it handles it, so after a key or a click that switches sessions
it reports once more for the session moved to. `lastUsed` is saved with the
session, at the latest 30 seconds after a use, and restored.

The tests are in `attach_most_recent_test.go`. A client that must not count
as the person is started with no key pressed: `attachIn` presses Alt+Esc,
which is the person using the session.

- `TestBareAttachLandsOnTheSessionTypedInLast` makes four sessions. Each of
  five rounds attaches a client to one session by name and uses it, then a
  bare attach must land there. Rounds 1, 3 and 5 type a command into the
  pane. Rounds 2 and 4 press Alt and a number in window mode.
- `TestBareAttachIgnoresAgentWindowsAndRoutedCommands` has a client sit on
  `watched`. The person types in `person`. Then windows open in `agent`
  from the CLI and `select-workspace` is routed to the client on `watched`.
  A bare attach must land on `person`. The positive half comes first:
  before any typing, the agent's windows make `agent` the pick.
- `TestBareAttachIgnoresKeysSentToATerminalModeClient` is the second
  review's case. A client sits on `watched` in terminal mode. The person
  types in `person`, then `tuios send-keys -s watched` types a command, which
  runs in the pane there. A bare attach must land on `person`.
- `TestBareAttachFollowsASwitchFromTheSessionBrowser` is the third review's
  case. The person attaches to `first`, switches to `second` in the session
  browser, reads it with no key, and detaches. A bare attach must land on
  `second`. Every key the person pressed was used in `first`, which is the
  positive half.
- `TestBareAttachAfterARestartLandsOnTheSessionTypedInLast` types in `alpha`
  of `alpha`, `beta` and `gamma`, runs `kill-server`, and a bare attach that
  starts the daemon again must land on `alpha`.

The fixed build passed three runs in a row.

precedes the typing already marks the session for a save, a crash, a client
inside a pane, and a mix of an old client with a new daemon.

## A pane reports a pixel size of zero (#506)

A Textual app quit with `ZeroDivisionError` when the mouse entered its pane.
Textual turns on in-band resize reports (mode 2048) and then SGR-pixel mouse
reports (mode 1016). It takes pixels per cell from the 2048 report and divides
each mouse report by it. The pure Go emulator sent `0;0` for the pixels in
every 2048 report. libghostty-vt sent no 2048 report and no XTWINOPS 14, 16 or
18 answer, because tuios never gave it the size callback. A pane that no
client had measured, such as a detached session's, also had a TIOCGWINSZ pixel
size of zero.

The fix takes every pixel size from one cell: the host's, or the fallback cell
in `internal/cellsize` (10x20) before a client reports one. The 2048 report,
XTWINOPS 14 and 16, the pty's winsize from its spawn on, and the 1016 mouse
reports all use it. A guest with 2048 on gets a new report when the cell size
changes.

The guest in `pixel_size_test.go` reads TIOCGWINSZ, the 2048 report and
XTWINOPS 14 and 16, and prints each SGR-pixel mouse report.
`TestPaneReportsItsPixelSize` runs it in a standalone and a daemon session
with an 8x16 host cell. Every size must match that cell, and two hovers one
cell apart must be reported 8 pixels apart. `TestDetachedPaneReportsAPixelSize`
runs it in a detached session: the sizes must match the fallback cell. A
client with an 8x16 cell then attaches, and the guest's last 2048 report must
be in 8x16 cells. A real Textual 8.2.8 app, run the same way, quit with the
reported traceback on main and mapped six hovers to six consecutive cells with
the fix, on both backends. That run is not in the suite, because CI has no
Textual.

`TestGhosttyDiffPixelSizeReports` (`-tags ghostty`) compares the two backends'
answers to 14, 16, 18 and 2048, with and without a host cell, and after a new
cell size.

Not covered end to end: macOS, a host that reports its cell size itself
rather than through `TUIOS_CELL_SIZE`, and a resize of a detached pane, which
goes through the winsize fallback.

### Review fixes: one client's cell, and no repeated reports

The pane's cell flipped between clients with different fonts: each client set
it on its own attach and its own pane resizes. It is now one client's cell
(`sessionCellSize`). Under `window_size = latest` that is the latest client,
which owns the session's size. Under smallest and largest, no client owns the
size, so it is the client that attached first. A client that reported no cell
is skipped. Every change to who is attached, and to who owns the size, goes
through `recalculateAndBroadcastSize`, which now gives every pane that cell.

`TestPaneCellFollowsOneClient` starts the guest in a detached session with the
fallback cell. Client a attaches with an 8x16 cell and client b with 12x24.
Every 2048 report the guest gets must stay in a's cell. When a leaves, the cell
must move to b's, which is the positive half.

The ghostty backend now ignores the same cell set twice. The library sends a
2048 report on every resize, and the daemon sets the cell on every pane resize
and every attach. `Emulator.SetCellSize` ignores a zero cell, as the ghostty
backend does. `TestPaneReportsItsPixelSize` also checks the absolute x of the
first hover: the centre of the pane cell under it, from the pane's first
column on the screen.

The 2048 reports are not held back during a drag with the winsize hold. The
pure emulator sends its report when it applies the resize in the output

## The rail's terminals header runs into the peeked name

While the pointer peeks a session row, the terminals header names that session
on its right, in front of the add control. The name was sized from half the
rail, which ignored the label. On a narrow rail the header read
"terminalssession-1", and at some widths the add control moved one cell off its
spine. `sidebarHeaderRow` now keeps two blank cells (`sidebarHeaderGap`) after
every header label and cuts the right element from its front. The terminals
header sizes the name from the room the row really has, and shows no name when
fewer than three cells are left. The add, cd and agents controls refuse to draw
closer than the same gap.

`TestRailHeaderKeepsAGapBeforeThePeekedName` peeks a session with a long name
at rail widths 16, 18, 20 and 24. It checks the gap after "terminals", that the
header names the session at 20 and up (the positive half), that the add control
is on its spine, and that a click on it makes a pane.

Width 16 passes the two narrow controls because no name fits there. The first
control covers it.

## Frame clock

`TestFramePacingKeepsTheGuestsRate` runs the `framepace` guest at 120 Hz with
max_fps 120 and at 240 Hz with max_fps 240. It asserts the frames shown a
second, the p95 interval and the p50 latency from guest to host.
`TestFloodStaysSmooth` runs the guest as a flood and asserts the host's frame
rate and p95 gap. Both are wall-clock measurements, so they run only with
`TUIOS_E2E_PERF` set. `TestKickFlushWritesTheFrame` in `internal/app` pins
the Bubble Tea behaviour the flush kick depends on.

`TestTypingLatencyStaysLow` also fails on origin/main with 8 panes (p99 22.8
ms), which had the same tail for a different reason.

Not covered: the latency assertion was added after the first controls ran.
On the released build the 120 Hz guest measured a p50 latency of 14.8 ms and
with the kick cut 14.9 ms, both over the 12 ms bound. The frame gate across
panes (`takePaneOutput`) has no control of its own: with nine guests the
shown rate is noisy on a shared machine, and the gate's effect is CPU, 600
against 908 ms/s, which the suite does not assert.

## Kitty streams without a compose

`TestKittyStreamCostsLittle` runs the `framepace` guest as a 240 Hz shared
memory stream and asserts the client's CPU, and as a 120 Hz stream of 64x64
frame edits and asserts the p95 latency from guest to host. Under
`TUIOS_E2E_PERF`.

| Control | How | Tests that fail | Verdict |

The edit control measured 2.5 ms against a 2 ms bound when it ran; the bound
is now 1.5 ms, against 0.9 to 0.95 ms with the change.

`TestGraphicsOnlyRefusesAChunkOfAnEarlierCommand` (`internal/terminal`) fails
on the classifier before the review fix: it accepted the last chunk,
`\x1b_Gm=0;...`, of an a=T without C=1 whose first chunk came in an earlier
write. `FuzzGraphicsOnlyAfterAWrite` keeps the two inputs it found, a write
after half a UTF-8 character and one after an open sixel DCS.

Not covered: a guest whose cursor is visible, which takes the usual path, and
a placement without `C=1`, which `graphicsOnly` refuses.

## Live CPU and RAM settings leave the samplers off

Enabling `appearance.show_cpu` or `appearance.show_ram` changed the rendered
meter but did not add its sampler to the dock engine. The settings page's save
is a self-write, so the config watcher correctly ignores it and cannot repair
the missing schedule. `DockMetersSyncCmd`, called after the message handler,
now reloads the dock only when a placed meter's enabled state differs from its
sampler membership. It uses the existing engine cancellation and listener path.

`TestDockMetersFollowLiveSettings` drives both the settings page and
`set-config` on a real attached client. It checks sampled text, the two-second
interval and advancing `last_run`, then disables, re-enables and disables both
meters. Frames and JSON listings are written through `TUIOS_E2E_FRAMES`.

| Control | How | Tests that fail | Verdict |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Missing post-handler hook | build on `f3d89294` with a Go overlay cutting the `DockMetersSyncCmd` call from `Update` and its unused batch variable; helper left intact | `TestDockMetersFollowLiveSettings/settings`, `/set-config`, and `TestDockMeterSyncDoesNotReloadAnUnchangedPlan/placed=true`: enabled CPU has `refresh=render` and empty interval, text and last_run | **caught** (3 subtests) |

The negative run used `-count=1`; both settings paths and the placed meter's
positive half timed out at the sampler assertion, not at the settings control.
The omitted meter's positive half passes the control because adding it through
the config watcher already rebuilds the engine. All four subtests pass with
the post-handler hook wired in.

`TestDockMeterSyncDoesNotReloadAnUnchangedPlan` checks enabled meters omitted
from the dock, disabled placed meters, and repeated settings. A custom `once`
component records its starts; unchanged sampler membership must not restart it.
The same fixture then enables or places CPU: its sampler must start and the
custom component must restart exactly once. Both layout cases pass on the fixed
build. This patch does not change the clock's sampler lifecycle.

## Home and End in copy mode (#515)

`copy_mode_home_end_test.go` puts the copy cursor on the middle of a line.
`TestCopyModeHomeAndEnd` requires `Home` and `End` to reach the columns `0`
and `$` reach, and reads the clipboard after `v Home y` and `v End y`.
`TestCopyModeEndRebinds` moves `copy_mode_line_end` to `ctrl+e`. `End` must
then leave the cursor on the match, and `ctrl+e` must move it to the column
`$` reaches. The unit test `TestEveryDefaultBindingReachesItsAction` presses
both default keys in both modes.

Not covered end to end: multi copy mode looks the action up at its own call
site in `handleMultiCopyKey`, and no test presses `Home` there.

### Help order and the doctor for copy_mode keys

`TestHelpListsHomeAndEndWithTheLineKeys` opens the help overlay, unfiltered,
on its copy mode section and wants the `home` and `end` rows right after the
`0, ^, $` row. `TestKeybindsDoctorNamesACopyModeKeyUsedTwice` binds
`copy_mode_line_start` to `v` and `copy_mode_line_end` to a copy pipe's `p`,
and wants the doctor to name both and not the default `home` and `end`. Its
positive half runs the defaults and wants no copy mode problem.

## A copy trims the whitespace it covers (#516)

`copy_whitespace_test.go` prints indented lines and reads each copy off the
wire as OSC 52, untrimmed. `TestCopyKeepsPrintedWhitespace` copies a line
with `V y` and with `0 v $ y`, three lines with `V j j y`, a line with a triple
click and three lines with a drag. The lines hold leading spaces, interior
runs and a tab. `TestCopyKeepsSpacesAtASoftWrap` copies one long indented line
that the pane wraps over more than three rows, with a space on the last column
of at least one row. Both run alone and through a daemon.

| Screen rows read at the window's width | `selectionRowCells` sized by `window.Width`, which counts the border | `TestCopyKeepsSpacesAtASoftWrap`, both modes (two extra spaces at every wrap) | **caught** |
| The pad a wide character leaves at a wrap copied as a space | `extractVisualText` keeps the last cell of a padded row | `TestCopyKeepsSpacesAtASoftWrap`, both modes ("the line wrapped before a wide character copied as" a space before the wide character). The pure Go build and the ghostty build both fail | **caught** |
| The ghostty backend reports no pad | `ghosttySpacerHead` returns false, as `RowPadded` did before | `TestCopyKeepsSpacesAtASoftWrap` on a `-tags ghostty` build, both modes. The same test passes on the ghostty build with the fix | **caught** |

The wide case prints a line that fills the pane to one column short of its
width, then a wide character, so the character wraps early on any pane width.

## Borderless zoom

`TestZoomBorderless` zooms one of two panes with `appearance.zoom_borderless`
on. It asserts the shell's size is the whole pane region, that no border cell
is drawn there, that a drag from the region's first cell copies the text there,
and that the pane's edge is back after zooming out. On the daemon run it also
turns the option off and on with `set-config` while the pane is zoomed, and
the border follows. It runs standalone, on a
daemon, under shared borders at zoom_size 90, with zoom_max_width 60, in a
light theme, on a floating pane and beside the rail. The boxed run is the
positive half: with the option off, the same probe finds the border and a
shell two cells smaller each way.

| The zoom box keeps the border | `applyZoomRectAnimated`: the line that drops the border under the option cut | 6 of 7 borderless runs (98x26). `borderless/shared` passes: shared borders already drop the border, and the zoom is still the whole region | **caught** |
| Zooming out keeps the pane borderless | `ToggleZoom`: the `settleUnzoomedBorder` call cut | `borderless/floating` ("no border after zooming out"). The tiled runs pass: the retile gives a tiled pane its border back on its own | **caught** |

## Mode pill icons from the config

`TestDockModeIconsFollowTheConfig` sets `appearance.dock_mode_icon_window`,
`_terminal` and `_tiling`, and reads the dock row of the real binary. It
checks the configured icon in place of the default, a four-cell icon that
grows the pill by its width and moves the workspace readout by the same
amount, an empty icon that draws no pill, a nine-cell icon that falls back to
the default, and the same wide icon in the compact dock. The unset row is the
positive half of the hidden and too-wide cases.

## OSC 7501, the Program Status Protocol

`program_status_test.go` runs a script in a shell pane that reports through
OSC 7501 and `tuios status`. `TestProgramStatusDrivesTheRailAndInbox` follows
each report to `get-agent-state`, the rail, the Inbox and the dock, and covers
the `?` reply, child records, a clear, a hostile message, the script's exit,
OSC 133 A while the program still runs, and typing.
`TestProgramStatusQueryStandalone` asks the query without a daemon.
`TestProgramStatusReachesTheHostTerminal` reads what tuios reports to
`hostterm -program-status`. Its subtests for a host that does not answer and a
config that turns the reports off are the negative halves, in the same
fixture. Each control cuts one call site. All three tests pass on the pure Go
build and on a `-tags ghostty` build.

### Review fixes

The review of #546 found that a working record went while its program still
ran, and four smaller faults. `program_status_rules_test.go` adds
`TestProgramStatusOutlivesTheShellCheck` (a pane whose own process is the
script, and a background job: both keep their working record past two
detector readings), `TestProgramStatusYieldsToAHook` (a hook's state keeps the
pane against a report and survives the records ending), and
`TestProgramStatusAuthIsAnsweredInThePane`. The host test now also detaches
and wants a clear for the record it left. Step 6 of the rail test is the
positive half of the first: a script that reported from the foreground and
exited loses its working record.

The rest of the review is held by unit tests: a malformed id, strict base64
and ASCII-only trimming by `TestParse` and the oracle in `FuzzParse`, and the
control bytes inside the string by `TestConform_ProgramStatusReports` on both
backends.

### Second review fixes

The second review found that one foreground exit ended a background job's
record too, that the alert limit dropped a real change of state, and that a
released pane got back a weaker source's state that might be stale.
`TestProgramStatusOutlivesTheShellCheck` gains a background job that reports
first and a foreground program beside it, whose exit must end only its own
record, and a program that lives a fifth of a second. The new
`TestProgramStatusAlertAfterTheGap` blocks a pane on a login and makes it done
three seconds later: the done notification must not reach the stand-in host
terminal inside the 30 seconds and must reach it after.
`TestProgramStatusYieldsToAHook` now wants the pane left with no state when
the program lets go of a pane it took from the screen tier.

Not covered end to end: a program that reports and exits in the same instant
(the race the docs describe: on an idle machine 0 of 20 such programs kept
their record with the read in the PTY reader, and 0 of 20 on the build that
read it at parse time; the review saw 2 of 10 under load), and the exit
rule for a pane on another machine, which needs a second host.

Not covered end to end: the exit of the pane's own process (`noteExit`),
because the pane closes with it; OSC 9;4 being ignored after OSC 7501, since
the `program` claim outranks OSC 9;4 while records exist, so no screen differs;
and a full reset, which the vt conformance test covers on both backends.

## A config split over several files

`config_include_test.go` and `config_layers_test.go` drive #518 through the
real binary and real files. A store file is a 0444 file in a 0555 directory,
linked into the config directory, the way Nix and home-manager put it there.

- `TestIncludedConfigFilesLoadAndReload`: a binding in an included file works at
  start. Saves to the included file, to a new `config.d` file and to an include
  that was missing at start each reach the running client. The positive half:
  the second chord does not fire before its file is saved.
- `TestSetConfigWritesTheFileThatHoldsTheKey`: `set-config` writes the included
  file that holds the key, and config.toml keeps its include list. A key that a
  0444 file holds goes to config.toml, the file stays byte for byte the same,
  and the client shows "cannot write".
- `TestConfigCommandsWriteTheFileThatHoldsTheKey`: `config files`,
  `hosts add`, `hosts remove`, `keybinds unbind` and `config origin` against
  includes, a cycle, a missing file and a 0444 file.
- `TestFirstStartWithNixStyleConfigD`: no config.toml, and a store link in
  `config.d`. The first start writes a config.toml with no setting but
  `[startup]`, the store file's binding works, and `set-config` of a key the
  store holds adds exactly one line to config.toml.
- `TestReadOnlyConfigTomlLink`: config.toml is a store link that includes a
  writable `local.toml`. A new key goes to `local.toml` with its comment kept. A
  key the store config.toml holds fails with "cannot save". With `local.toml`
  read-only too, the save fails with "cannot write" and changes nothing.
- `TestSymlinkedIncludeEditedInPlace`: an include is a link to a file in
  another directory, and an edit in place to the target reaches the client.
- `TestMixedNamedAndUnnamedCommandEntries`: an unnamed `[[keybindings.command]]`
  entry changes the named entry with its key, a named entry the later file does
  not mention stays, a `disabled = true` entry removes its match, and a new
  entry is added.
- `TestMergeOrderIncludeThenConfigDThenMain`: one chord in three files.
  config.toml wins, then `config.d`, then the include.
- `TestConfigPruneLetsIncludesApply`: `config prune` removes the keys at their
  default, keeps comments, the include list, a chosen value and `[startup]`, and
  the included file's value then applies.
- `TestSaveDoesNotPinValuesTheModelHasNotSeen`: an included file changes where
  the client cannot see it. A save of another key writes neither the client's
  old value into config.toml nor back into the file.
- `TestIncludeMistakesAreNamed`: a missing `?` include is silent, a missing
  plain include warns, an include below a table warns, a self include says so,
  a link loop in a `?` include or in `config.d` is skipped with a warning, and
  a directory include fails with a message that names `config.d`.
- `TestRemovingAHostKeepsTheNextTablesComment`: a host cleared on the settings
  page leaves config.toml without its table. The comment above the next table
  stays, one blank line below the table before it.
- `TestIncludedFileIsNeverRewrittenWhole`: an included file sets the key in an
  inline table, which the line editor cannot change. The file stays byte for
  byte the same, the change goes to config.toml, and the client says so.
- `TestConfigCommandsWriteTheFileThatHoldsTheKey` also checks that a write to a
  file with CR LF line endings keeps them.

Artifacts: frames, the files after each save, and the command transcripts,
under `$TUIOS_E2E_FRAMES/<test name>/`.

Cutting only one of the two tombstone paths is not caught, and that is by
design: the matched entry merges the `disabled` key and the strip removes it.

Not covered here: the tombstones a save writes when it removes an entry that a
read-only file holds, and the tombstone it writes before an entry that must
not merge with an earlier file's entry. No screen and no command in tuios
writes an array of tables today, so no end-to-end test can reach these paths.
They wait for the first one that does.

```sh
go build -o /tmp/tuios ./cmd/tuios

## Single-client attach and detach-client (#549)

`detach_client_test.go` runs real clients against one daemon.
`TestAttachDetachOthersEndsTheOtherClients` attaches two clients the plain
way, which is the positive half: both stay attached. A third client with
`attach -d` then makes the first two exit 0 with "Another client attached to
this session." `TestSingleClientOptionDetachesOnEveryAttach` does the same
with `[daemon] single_client = true` and a plain attach.
`TestDetachClientByIDAndSession` detaches one of two clients by its id, while
the other stays. A pane with read, write and fan is refused the command, and
the tmux shim's `detach-client -s` takes the last client off. Each session
still runs at the end.

### Review fixes: racing attaches, viewers and `-a`

`TestConcurrentAttachDetachLeavesOneClient` attaches one client and then
starts two `attach -d` clients at the same moment, for six rounds. Each round
must end with one client attached and two that exit 0 with the message.
`TestSingleClientIgnoresAViewOnlyClient` attaches a `TUIOS_VIEW_ONLY=1`
client under `single_client`, which must leave the owner attached. A plain
attach after it detaches both, which is the positive half.
`TestDetachClientAllOther` keeps one client with `--client ID --all-other`,
and keeps the newest with the shim's `detach-client -a -s`.

### Second review: the attach lock, the reply check and the shim's -s

These deterministic regressions live in `internal/session/detach_client_test.go`.
Each lands one event inside an attach through the `attachSnapshotTaken` hook.

- `TestAPanicInsideAnAttachLeavesTheSessionUnlocked` panics once inside an
  attach. The next attach to the session must return.
- `TestADetachInsideAnAttachLeavesTheAttachingClientAlone` runs
  `detach-client -s` inside a second client's attach. The fully attached first
  client goes. The attaching client gets its session and stays attached.
- `TestADetachNoticeBeforeTheHandlerIsDelivered` detaches a client after its
  read loop starts and before its handler is set. The handler must still get
  the notice.
- `TestDetachClientAllOther` now checks the shim against tmux 3.7c, which was
  checked by hand on a private tmux server. `-a -t tuios-S` keeps the newest
  client. `-a -s S` detaches every client of S.

## Images on a host without graphics (kmscon)

A pane's sixel image on a host with neither sixel nor kitty graphics, such as
the Linux console under kmscon, used to show as a box with "image" in it. It is
now drawn as block glyphs, one glyph with two colours per image cell
(`appearance.image_symbols`, `internal/mosaic`). The pane is told it can draw
sixel, so programs send the picture.

`TestImageSymbolsOnAHostWithoutGraphics` draws a generated picture (sky, sun,
hills, a red band, a checker) in a pane, for each glyph set, in a daemon
session, and at 256 colours. It reads the picture back off the host's screen:
each glyph is turned back into its shape, and its two colours are compared with
the source averaged over the same sub-cells. The glyphs must also beat a flat
cell on the cells with an edge in them. It then scrolls the picture partly out
of the pane and clears it. `TestSixelFallbacks/plain` checks the default (the
picture is drawn) and `plain-off` the positive half (the box, and no sixel in
DA1). `TestImageSymbolsWithChafa` runs chafa, which picks sixel from the DA1.
chafa draws octants of its own when it does not pick sixel, so the test reads
the passthrough's debug log: the octant run must register a sixel image drawn
as glyphs, and the `off` run none.

The daemon variant first ran standalone without anyone noticing: its config
file had no `startup.daemon`, and the controls on the daemon wiring passed. The
test now writes `startup.daemon = true` when it asks for a daemon, and both
controls below fail.

| Control | How | Tests that fail | Verdict |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| The glyph pass draws nothing | `drawImageSymbols`: returns at once | `octant-standalone` (error 377 against a ceiling of 10, nothing to clear) | **caught** |
| The daemon does not count a glyph client | `refreshTreeOps`: `cs.symbolImages` cut | `octant-daemon` (pane DA1 is `62;22`) | **caught** |
| The hello does not carry it | `Connect`: `hello.SymbolImages` cut | `octant-daemon` (pane DA1 is `62;22`) | **caught** |
| The sextant table is off by one | `buildSextants`: first code point U+1FB01 | `sextant-standalone` (error 15.3, edge cells 49.9 against a flat 32.8) | **caught** |
| Default off | `imageSymbolKind`: auto gives `Off` | `TestSixelFallbacks/plain` (DA1 has no 4, the box is shown) | **caught** |
| The pane is not told sixel | `Advertised`: false in symbols mode | `TestImageSymbolsWithChafa/octant` (no image registered, 20 glyph cells) | **caught** |

The octant and sextant tables were also checked once against the Unicode 16
character names (Python's `unicodedata`): every one of the 256 and 64 shapes
names the right cells. The e2e decode reads plane 1 glyphs through
`mosaic.Shape`, the table's inverse, so a table error that is its own inverse
would pass it; the name check is what covers that.

### The glyph set by terminal, and the 16-colour floor

`auto` picks the glyph set from `TERM`: octants on kmscon, half blocks on the
Linux console, quadrants elsewhere. At 16 colours the cells are half blocks
dithered to the ANSI colours, with no bright background, and a picture under
`mosaic.MinFidelity` shows the box. A host that answers for sixel or kitty
never gets glyphs.

`TestImageSymbolsAutoPicksByTerminal` runs one row per choice with the setting
at `auto`. `kmscon` must show octants and no sextants, at the same error
ceiling. `other` (`TERM=xterm-256color`) must show no sextant or octant.
`linux` must hold only half blocks, every colour an ANSI index, no background
above 7, and a lightness correlation of at least 0.8 with the picture (0.92
measured). `linux-truecolor` must hold half blocks in 24-bit colour.
`kmscon-with-sixel` must be sent sixel and draw no glyph. `TestSixelFallbacks`
also checks that the sixel and kitty hosts' image cells are not drawn as text.

| Control | How | Tests that fail | Verdict |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

| Bright backgrounds allowed | `halfCell16`: the dark-background case taken always | `linux` (bright background 12) | **caught** |
| The threshold shows the box | `MinFidelity` 1.01 | `linux` (the box is shown) | **caught**; this is also the positive half of the box path |
| Default octants elsewhere | `imageSymbolKind`: `Octant` by default | `other` (102 octant cells) | **caught** |
| Glyphs before sixel | `chooseSixelMode`: the symbols case first | `kmscon-with-sixel` (no sixel sent, 336 glyph cells) | **caught** |

Not caught end to end: the dither itself. Without it the test picture, which
is at full contrast, still correlates above 0.8; the loss shows only on
low-contrast pictures.

### Shading, the drawing budget and colour

The glyphs used to be put on the frame after every shading pass, so a modal's
scrim and an unfocused pane's dim left the picture at full brightness.
`TestImageSymbolsAreShaded/modal` opens the command palette over a picture
(`modal_dim = 30`) and requires at least 90% of the picture's light cells
outside the palette to be darker; the pane border must be darker too, which is
the positive half. `unfocused` opens a second pane with `dim_unfocused = 40`
under a theme and requires the same of the first pane's picture.

`TestImageSymbolsFlood` sends 150 pictures of 100x30 cells back to back. The
debug log must show a picture that waited for the pane's drawing budget and
the budget coming back, and the last picture must be drawn after the flood.
The test first waits until tuios has sent the host nothing for a second: its
startup hint draws a frame every 300 ms for about six seconds, and one of
those frames drew the waiting picture, which hid a cut wake. Each draw is made
to cost 300 ms (`TUIOS_E2E_SYMBOL_DRAW_COST`), so the debt at the end of the
flood takes over a second to pay back on any machine.

`TestImageSymbolsKeepAPictureOnScreen` draws picture A (20x10 cells), then
redraws a 25x12 picture beside it 160 times, which is past the pane's 16 MiB
image budget. A is the oldest image and on screen throughout, so it must still
be drawn. The glyph pass used to swap every marker before the scan, so the
frame's visible set stayed empty and the eviction took A. The debug log must
record all 161 images, so the budget was really filled.

`TestImageSymbolsWithoutColour` runs with `NO_COLOR=1`: the pane's DA1 must
not list sixel and a picture shows the box. The positive half is
`TestImageSymbolsOnAHostWithoutGraphics`.

| Control | How | Tests that fail | Verdict |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

| Glyphs not given the pane's dim | `drawImageSymbols`: the `dimCell` step cut | `TestImageSymbolsAreShaded/unfocused` (0 of 480 light cells darker) | **caught** |
| No colour still draws glyphs | `symbolColors`: ASCII and NoTTY reported as coloured | `TestImageSymbolsWithoutColour` (DA1 `62;4;22`, 234 glyph cells) | **caught** |
| No frame when the budget is back | `wakeWhenBudgetLocked`: the wake cut | `TestImageSymbolsFlood` (0 glyph cells after 10 s) | **caught**; it was not before the test waited out the startup frames |
| Glyph images not counted as on screen | `SetFrame`: the images drawn as glyphs left out of `visible` | `TestImageSymbolsKeepAPictureOnScreen` (A has 0 glyph cells and no box) | **caught** |

A run with the reader drawing only one cell of each picture, so the frame pass
draws the rest, passes `TestImageSymbolsOnAHostWithoutGraphics`: the part drawn
later meets the part drawn first.

Not covered end to end: a local terminal that answers the startup DA1 after the
probe gave up. The test terminal answers DA1 itself, at once, so the late
answer cannot be staged. Nor is `symbol_images` in an SSH client's hello: no
e2e test runs an SSH client on a host without graphics.

Not covered: a real kmscon. It needs a free VT and DRM master, which this
machine's test run must not take. A kitty graphics image on such a host is not
drawn: the pane is still told kitty graphics are absent, and programs fall back
to their own output.

## The ssh agent link (#549)

`TestSSHAgentLinkFollowsTheNewestClient` runs with `[daemon] ssh_agent =
"follow"` and fake agent sockets in folders the test makes. Two clients
attach with different sockets, and the link on disk follows the attach order.
A client whose `SSH_AUTH_SOCK` is a symlink moves the link to the socket the
symlink names. Clients with a socket in a folder anyone can write to, a
symlink to such a socket, a socket in a private folder under a folder anyone
can write to, and a path that is not there leave the link where it was. The
daemon has no socket of its own here. A new pane prints
the link's name from `SSH_AUTH_SOCK` and finds a socket there. A client that
runs inside a pane attaches a second session and makes no link, and the same
socket from a client outside every pane does: that is the positive half. A
detach moves the link back to the first client, and when the last client
drops, the link is gone.

The rows above were run on the first version of the pull request. The rows
below were run on the review fixes, with
`TestSSHAgentLinkFallsBackToTheDaemonsSocket` added. That test starts the
daemon with a socket of its own. The link points at it before any client
attaches and after the last client leaves. `kill-server` removes the link. A
stale link in the folder is swept when the daemon starts again, and the link
of a daemon on another socket in the same folder is kept.

`TestSSHAgentFollowsThroughAHost` runs a hub and a remote daemon on one
machine. Both have `ssh_agent = "follow"`, and the link has
`ssh_options = ["-A"]`. Neither daemon has an agent of its own. The ssh
stand-in forwards the agent the way `ssh -A` does: the far command gets a
relay socket, and each connection to the relay reaches the socket that the
stand-in's own `SSH_AUTH_SOCK` names. A person attaches the far session from
the hub with a real `ssh-agent` that holds one key. `ssh-add -L` in the far
pane must print that key's comment.

The rows below were run on the second review's fixes. Each host now has its
own link, and only a host that forwards gets it.

- `TestSSHAgentHostLinkFollowsOnlyThatHostsClients` uses three real
  ssh-agents. A attaches the far session through the link, and B attaches a
  session of the hub. The far pane must still reach A. C then attaches the
  far session, and the far pane reaches C, which is the positive half. A
  types in the far pane, and the hub's link for the host moves back to A.
- `TestSSHAgentLinkLeavesANonForwardingHostAlone` starts the hub with an
  agent of its own and three hosts: `-A`, `ssh -G` saying `forwardagent yes`,
  and neither. The two that forward start with their own host link. The
  third starts with the daemon's `SSH_AUTH_SOCK`.
- `TestSSHAgentFollowWithAnOlderDaemon` needs `TUIOS_E2E_OLD_BIN`, a build of
  main from before the feature. It was run with main at 01d72efb. The client
  must draw the far session with an old far daemon and with an old hub
  daemon.

The rows below were run on the third round. `TestSSHAgentHostLinkNames` gives
the hub three forwarding hosts: Pair and pair, which differ only in case, and
a name of 70 characters. Each one starts with its own link, and Pair's and
pair's links do not differ only in case. A host with `-A` then `-a` keeps the
daemon's environment, as `ssh -G` says. A reload that drops pair removes
pair's link and keeps Pair's. `kill-server` sweeps every host link, the long
one included.

| The sweep does not see host links | `isOwnAgentLink`: false for `link-` | `TestSSHAgentHostLinkNames` (Pair's link stays after `kill-server`) | **caught** |

These two are not covered by an e2e test. A late note from the relay's timer
after a connection closed is now refused under the same lock the close
forgets the client under. A failed `ssh -G` is no longer cached.

## A glyph image in an unfocused pane

`TestImageSymbolsDimEvenly` draws a white disc with a light-grey speckle as
glyphs, with `theme = "dracula"` and `dim_unfocused = 50`. It runs at
truecolor with octants and quadrants, at 256 colours, and at 16 colours with
half blocks. It then moves the focus to a second pane. Every sub-block inside
the disc must stay within 12 of the focused spread, and the disc must be
darker than when it had the focus. The frames are `focused.png` and
`unfocused.png` under each subtest's artifact directory.

The control is main at 1b570369, where the glyph pass still calls `dimCell`.
It was run on 2026-10-07.

## Three flakes under load (2026-10-08)

Each test ran 30 times in a row on one machine. Eight busy loops ran at nice 19
on the same eight cores during each run. The "before" build is main at
`af79c927`, which is the control for each code fix.

| Test | Cause | Before | After |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `TestProgramStatusDrivesTheRailAndInbox` | The script reports a working root record and exits. The PTY reader can read the foreground group after the shell has it back. The read found no group, and the report then disarmed a record that had a group. The record outlived the script. A record now keeps its group when the read finds none. | 9 of 30 fail at step 6 (`the script exited: never held`, root `working` left) | 0 of 30 |
| `TestPiPWatchesAPaneFromTheCorner` | `View` reused a cached frame when the frame was skipped, but it read the cursor fresh. The cached frame had the box where the cursor was before. `View` now composes again when the box covers the cursor it shows. | 3 of 30 fail (`the view covered the cursor in 1 samples`, cursor (79,36)) | 0 of 30 |
| `TestChromeLooksAndFooters/dark-120x40-16` | The fixture started the approval hook and did not wait for it.

The chrome flake did not show on this machine. A hook that always misses its
deadline (`--timeout 1ns`) gives the CI failure exactly:
`chrome_looks_test.go:211: inbox never drew`.

## Frame memory and the connection cap

`TestDaemonBoundsStalledFrames` opens 32 connections. Each one announces a
16 MiB input frame, sends 15 MiB of it and stops. The daemon must grow by
less than 200 MB. A 1 MiB hello must get a refusal, and the next frame on
the same connection must get its answer. Of 300 idle connections to the link
socket, the daemon must refuse at least the 44 over the link cap, and `tuios
ls` must still answer. Of 1100 idle connections to the main socket, the
daemon must refuse at least the 76 over its cap and log the refusal, and
`tuios ls` must say the daemon has too many connections. `tuios ls` must
answer after the connections close. The measurements are in
`frame-memory.txt` under the test's artifact directory.

The controls were run on 2026-10-08 on the branch fix/bound-frame-memory.
The rows for the read budget and the connection cap were run again on the
design that charges a frame whole from its header. Without the change, the
test passes on that design with the daemon growing by 93 MB.

| Control | How | Tests that fail | Verdict |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| The build before the change | main at af79c927 | `TestDaemonBoundsStalledFrames`: the daemon grew by 517 MB, and the 1 MiB hello was decoded and answered "invalid hello payload" | **caught** |
| No read budget | `readClientFrame`: the acquire skipped, so no frame is charged | `TestDaemonBoundsStalledFrames`: the daemon grew by 907 MB | **caught** |
| No connection cap | `acceptLoop`: the `admitConnection` call cut | `TestDaemonBoundsStalledFrames`: the daemon refused 0 of 1100 connections, and `tuios ls` listed the sessions where it should say the daemon has too many connections | **caught** |
| The link sockets share the main cap | `acceptLinkOn`: `admitConnection` given `openConns` and `maxConnections` | `TestDaemonBoundsStalledFrames`: the daemon refused 0 of 300 link connections | **caught** |
| No short limit | `daemonFrameLimit`: the default case returns `maxFrameBytes` | `TestDaemonBoundsStalledFrames`: the 1 MiB hello was read and answered "invalid hello payload" | **caught** |

The unit tests in `internal/session/frame_budget_test.go` and
`verb_lines_test.go` have their own controls, each run once. Each fails at
least one of them:

- The budget taken in 1 MiB pieces, each piece kept while the next waits.
  Six concurrent 16 MiB frames and six concurrent 1 MiB verb lines all time
  out.
- A keystroke-sized frame charged to the budget.
- A link given the person's budget.
- An input frame's charge held while the input is written to the pane.
- A verb line's charge held until the verb returns. Two send-texts blocked
  in panes that do not read make the next set-buffer fail as busy.
- No bound of one waiting large input per pane, in `PTY.Write`.
- A second large write refused at once, with no wait for the pane's slot.
  Five of six 1 MiB send-texts into `cat` fail as busy.
- A second large write that waits for the slot with no end. A paste or
  send-text into a pane that does not read is never refused.
- No time limit on the client's hold behind a paste. With no pong, Enter
  is never sent.
- No check for a lost connection while input is held. Input to the held
  pane is queued with no error.
- No retry of a busy paste in the client.
- No hold of later input behind a paste: Enter overtakes the retried paste.
- The person working through a hub given the peers' budget.
- A refused connection closed without being told why.
- The body allocated whole from the header.
- No short limit.
- No cap in `admitConnection`.

## A Mac config.toml on Linux, and keys tuios cannot read (issue #556)

`TestMacConfigWorksOnLinux` loads the 25 `opt+` keys and the leader of the
reporter's config on Linux. `tuios keybinds doctor --json` must list no key
problem and note all 25 keys as read as `alt+`. In a daemon session, Alt+2 and
Alt+1 switch workspaces, Ctrl+S opens the prefix menu, and the log viewer has no
`Config:` line.

`TestUnreadableKeyKeepsTheRestOfTheFile` starts a daemon session with
`leader_key = 'ctrl+s'`, `switch_workspace_2 = ['ctrl+nope']` and
`terminal_exit_mode = ['hyper+esc']`. It waits for "2 config problems". Alt+2
must switch to workspace 2 on the default key, and Ctrl+S must open the prefix
menu.

`TestDoctorMatchesTheAppWithBadKeys` is the review repro of #559: an
unreadable leader and `switch_workspace_2 = ['alt+1']` in config.toml, and
`switch_workspace_1 = ['hyper+1']` in `config.d/keys.toml`. The doctor must say
the leader is `ctrl+b` and name each file. explain must say Alt+1 runs
`switch_workspace_2`. In the app, Alt+1 goes to workspace 2, Ctrl+B opens the
prefix menu, and the log viewer names both files.

`TestReloadWithABadKeyAppliesTheRest` saves a config with a bad key into a
running session, then saves one without it. The first reload must name
`ctrl+nope` and apply Alt+F7. The second must apply Alt+F8.

`TestConfigApplyListsTheKeysItCannotRead` runs `tuios config apply` with
`switch_workspace_3 = ['hyper+3']` in `config.d/keys.toml`. The output must
name the key, its file and the default key the action uses.

| Control | How | Tests that fail | Verdict |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `opt+` is rejected off macOS again | `ValidateKey`: the old `opt+`/`option+` rejection put back for `!isMacOS` | `TestMacConfigWorksOnLinux` (the doctor lists 25 keys tuios cannot read). With the doctor checks skipped, it fails at the log viewer, which lists the 25 keys | **caught** |
| The load rejects the whole file again | `LoadUserConfig`: return an error when `ValidateConfig` has errors, before the call to `DropUnreadableKeys` | `TestUnreadableKeyKeepsTheRestOfTheFile` (the TUI shows "1 config problem", the load failure, and not "2 config problems") | **caught** |
| The build before the fix | main at `d2f6277b` | `TestUnreadableKeyKeepsTheRestOfTheFile` (no config problem is shown). With that wait skipped, it fails at the prefix menu wait | **caught** |

| The doctor reads the file as written | `loadKeybindConfig`: the call to `DropUnreadableKeys` cut | `TestDoctorMatchesTheAppWithBadKeys` (the doctor says the leader is `hyper+a`). The app half passes, as it should: the app was right | **caught** |
| The fallback default does not yield | `DropUnreadableKeys`: the `keyHolder` check cut | `TestDoctorMatchesTheAppWithBadKeys` (explain says Alt+1 runs `switch_workspace_1`). With the doctor checks skipped, Alt+1 leaves the session on workspace 1 | **caught** |
| Every dropped key names config.toml | `DropUnreadableKeys`: `fileOf` returns `config.toml` | `TestDoctorMatchesTheAppWithBadKeys` (the doctor names `config.toml` for `hyper+1`). With the doctor checks skipped, the log viewer does not name `config.d/keys.toml` | **caught** |
| The reload rejects a bad key again | `validateLayered`: return an error when `ValidateConfig` has errors | `TestReloadWithABadKeyAppliesTheRest` (the TUI says "Config not reloaded" and never names `ctrl+nope`) | **caught** |
| `config apply` lists no dropped key | `verbApplyConfig`: the `dropped_keys` field cut from the reply | `TestConfigApplyListsTheKeysItCannotRead` (the output does not say "tuios cannot read 1 key") | **caught** |

The key presses alone cannot catch the first control. A dropped `opt+1` falls
back to the default `alt+1`, which is the same key on Linux. The doctor and the
log viewer are what tell the two builds apart.

## The saver's frame rate, and the tuios-web window limit

`TestScreensaverPaintsAtSixtyAtMost` reads the saver's frame rate off the
screen as the time an effect hides a marker. middleout counts frames (99), and
tuffbaby paces its clip by the clock, and its bound at max_fps 240 is 1.8 times
its own time at max_fps 60 on the same machine. The max_fps 30 case is the
positive half: it fails if max_fps never reaches the saver.

`TestWebClampsAWindowPastTheLimit` sends tuios-web a resize to 300x60, then
one to 1500x900. The first must reach the pane, which is the positive half.
Since sip v0.8.5 the second is clamped to 1200 columns and 208 rows (250000
cells), and the pane must take exactly that size less the chrome measured at
300x60. Before v0.8.5 sip ignored the second resize, and the test was
`TestWebIgnoresAWindowPastTheLimit`.

Each control below was run on 2026-10-08 at a load average near 30.

| Control | How | Tests that fail | Verdict |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| The saver ticks at NormalFPS again | main at `1db4d240` | `TestScreensaverPaintsAtSixtyAtMost` (middleout at max_fps 240 hides the screen for 0.48 s, want at least 1.2 s) | **caught** |
| The clock disagrees with the tick | `screensaverBuild`: `NewVirtualClock(s.NormalFPS)` in place of `screensaverRate(s)` | `TestScreensaverPaintsAtSixtyAtMost` (tuffbaby at max_fps 240 keeps the marker hidden for more than 16.81 s, which is 1.8 times its 9.34 s at max_fps 60. With the fix: 9.52 s at 60 and 10.08 s at 240. Rerun at a load average near 5) | **caught** |
| max_fps never reaches the saver | `screensaverRate` always returns `screensaverFPS` | `TestScreensaverPaintsAtSixtyAtMost` (middleout at max_fps 30 hides the screen for 1.62 s, want at least 2.6 s) | **caught** |
| No window limit | `cmd/tuios-web/main.go`: the `MaxWindowDims` line cut (main at `1db4d240`, sip v0.8.4) | `TestWebIgnoresAWindowPastTheLimit` (tuios-web grows from 45 MB to 857 MB, and the shell stops answering within 10 s) | **caught** |
| No window limit, sip v0.8.5 | `cmd/tuios-web/main.go`: `MaxWindowDims` 4096x4096 and `MaxWindowCells` 1 << 30 (branch `chore/sip-0.8.5`) | `TestWebClampsAWindowPastTheLimit` (the shell stops answering within 10 s of the 1500x900 resize) | **caught** |

With the sip v0.8.4 fix, tuios-web held 55 MB before the oversized resize and
59 MB after it. With sip v0.8.5 and the clamp, it held 57 MB before and 240 MB
after, at 1174x204 cells in the pane. Cutting only the `MaxWindowCells` line
leaves sip's default of 250000 cells, which is the same limit, so no test
fails on that change. The unit test `TestSaverClockRunsAtTheRateThePaintingDoes` in
`internal/app` holds the clock to the tick at 10, 30, 60, 120 and 240 fps, and
fails on the second control too.

## A theme from a config file reaches the panes

`TestAThemeInAConfigDFileReachesThePanes` saves a new config.d file that sets
`theme = "dracula"` and `border_style = "double"`. The double border is the
positive half: it shows that the reload reached the client. The test then
prints SGR 31 in the pane, and that colour must no longer reach the host as
palette index 1.

The control was run on 2026-10-08.

| Control | How | Tests that fail | Verdict |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| The reload does not push the palette into the panes | `ApplyReloadedConfig`: the `m.UpdateAllWindowThemes()` call cut (main at `b9522fb7`) | `TestAThemeInAConfigDFileReachesThePanes` (the double border appears, and SGR 31 still reaches the host as index 1) | **caught** |

A probe on the same build showed the bug for every kind of file: a new
config.d file, an edit to a config.d file, an included file and config.toml,
with and without a daemon. In each case the border took the new theme's colour
and the pane kept its old palette.

## Option characters and keyboard layouts (#566, #575)

`option_layout_keys_test.go` has nine tests. Each one sends the bytes that a
terminal writes for the key: WezTerm with a composing right Option key,
Terminal.app with Option on "Normal", iTerm2 with Esc+ on US and on French
AZERTY, and Kitty protocol reports for AZERTY and for a composing Option key.
`TUIOS_E2E_PLATFORM=darwin` puts tuios on its macOS defaults and its macOS key
paths. The default is `option_glyphs = "bind"`, the behaviour Terminal.app
and iTerm2 users already had, and `"type"` is the opt-in for #566. Every test
that says a key does nothing also presses a key that does something, in the
same session. Each control below cut one piece of wiring, built a binary, and
ran the named test against it, on 2026-10-08 on branch
`fix/option-composition-layouts`.

| Control: what was cut | Test | Where it failed |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `bindingKeys` asks for a composed character's chord as a plain key, not in the Option-glyph tier | `TestComposedOptionCharacterReachesThePane` | the shell never prints `x2•¡y` |
| `expandInto` skips the `OptionGlyphKey` claim | `TestNormalOptionCharacterSwitchesWorkspaceByDefault` | the default config leaves the session on workspace 1 for `£`, want 3 |
| `bindingKeys` never asks for the US-layout tier | `TestEscPlusOptionChordsOnAUSLayout` | ESC # leaves the session on workspace 1, want 3 |
| `expandInto` ignores `keyboard_layout = "other"` | `TestAzertyEscPlusWithLayoutOther` | ESC & moves the pane to workspace 7 |
| `expandInto` claims a US alias as a plain key | `TestOwnBindingBeatsTheUSAlias` | ESC & moves the pane to workspace 7, want workspace 2 |
| `bindingKeys` asks for the US-layout tier without `KeyFitsUSLayout` | `TestAzertyKittyReportsPickTheRightWorkspace` | AZERTY Option and the 1 key moves the pane to workspace 7 |
| `bindingKeys` drops the `shiftedKey` spelling | `TestAzertyKittyReportsPickTheRightWorkspace` | AZERTY Option, Shift and the 1 key leaves the session on workspace 3, want 1 |
| `lookupAction` does not hand back the host's base-layout key | `TestAzertyKittyReportsPickTheRightWorkspace` | AZERTY Option and the 1 key moves the pane to workspace 7 |
| `isLeaderKey` drops the `composedChords` loop | `TestOptionLeaderFiresOnTheComposedCharacter` | `¡` with `leader_key = "opt+1"` never opens the prefix menu |
| `expandInto` fills the Option-glyph tier whatever `option_glyphs` says | `TestKittyComposedCharacterFollowsOptionGlyphs` | the Kitty `CSI 176;4u` moves the pane to workspace 8 under `"type"` |
| The input handler drops the `optionGlyphsApply` check before the note | `TestKittyComposedCharacterFollowsOptionGlyphs` | the note about Option shows under `"type"` |
| `composedChords` ignores the base-layout key | `TestAzertyCedillaIsNotOptionC` | AZERTY ç with base-layout key 9 moves the pane to workspace 4 |

Against main at `797ea69e`, the four AZERTY and alias tests fail as
expected, and `TestEscPlusOptionChordsOnAUSLayout` passes, as the positive
half should. The tests that need the macOS key paths cannot be judged on a
build of main, because main does not read `TUIOS_E2E_PLATFORM`. The controls
above are the evidence for those.

Against the previous head of this branch, `6a4af01e`, run in macOS mode, the
tests the review asked for fail where they should:

| Test | Where it failed on `6a4af01e` |
| --- | --- |
| `TestOptionLeaderFiresOnTheComposedCharacter` | `¡` never opens the prefix menu |
| `TestKittyComposedCharacterFollowsOptionGlyphs` | the Kitty `°` moves the pane to workspace 8 under `"type"` |
| `TestAzertyCedillaIsNotOptionC` | AZERTY ç with base-layout key 9 moves the pane to workspace 4 |

## A default config in a browser session (clienttests)

The two tests are in `clienttests/config.spec.mjs`. They read the log viewer
of a browser session. The first one attaches to a server whose file sets
`notify = true`. The log must hold an INFO notice for it and no WARN line.
That is the positive half. The second one attaches to a server whose file has
no `[notifications]` table. Its log must hold no `[notifications.agent]` line.

The controls were run on 2026-10-08.

| Control | How | Tests that fail | Verdict |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| The browser check reads the resolved default | `browserAlertNotices`: the `alerts.Notify != nil` gate cut | the default test (the log holds the notify line). The positive half still passes. | **caught** |
| The whole fix removed | tuios-web built from main at `2fcc83a4` | both tests (the line is a WARN config problem, and the default config logs it) | **caught** |

## tuios-web hands --allow-host to sip

`TestWebAllowHostLetsAProxyNameIn` starts tuios-web on loopback with
`--no-auth --allow-host term.example`. A handshake with Host `term.example`
must get a session, which is the reverse proxy case. A handshake with Host
`evil.example` must get a 403, which is the DNS rebinding case. The loopback
address and `localhost` must get a session, so a server that refuses every
name cannot pass.

sip v0.8.5 checks the Host header before tuios-web's own middleware runs. A
name that tuios-web does not put in `sip.Config.AllowedHosts` gets a 403 from
sip, whatever tuios-web allows.

Each control below was run on 2026-10-08 on branch `chore/sip-0.8.5`.

| Control | How | Tests that fail | Verdict |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| tuios-web does not hand the names to sip | `webAccess.apply`: the `cfg.AllowedHosts = a.allowHosts` line cut | `TestWebAllowHostLetsAProxyNameIn` (Host `term.example` gets 403, want 101), and the unit test `TestAllowHostAddsAName` | **caught** |
| The Host check is off | `webAccess.apply`: `"*"` added to `cfg.AllowedHosts` | `TestWebAllowHostLetsAProxyNameIn` (Host `evil.example` gets 101, want 403) | **caught** |

## State a reattach has to carry that no cell shows

`TestWireCarriesTheCursorState` and `TestWireNarrowsAWiderClient` in
`internal/session` restore a snapshot, feed both emulators the sequence that
reads the state, and compare them. The ghostty build runs the same cases pure to
ghostty, ghostty to pure and ghostty to ghostty
(`TestGhosttyWireCarriesTheCursorState`, `TestGhosttyWireNarrowsAWiderClient`).
Each case runs in both wire forms, so one case is two subtests. These are unit
tests, kept because they hold the wire. On 2026-10-08 each control cut one call
site and ran the tests on both builds. Every control failed where shown, and the
same tests passed on the branch.

On `main` at `797ea69e`, with only the tests added, 32 of 56 pure cases fail,
and so do all 8 wider-client cases. On the ghostty build 28, 52 and 44 of 56
fail pure to ghostty, ghostty to pure and ghostty to ghostty.

| Control: what was cut | Where it failed |

| The OSC 8 the ghostty restore writes for the pen's link | 12 subtests: the three `open-link` cases into a ghostty client |
| `penExtrasLocked` in the ghostty `CursorPen` | 16 subtests: the `open-link` cases from a ghostty daemon, and into one where the client's pen is read |
| `RestoreProtectedCells` for the active screen in `ApplyTerminalState` | 12 pure, 48 ghostty: the six cases a selective erase reads on the active screen. `protected-cells-ed-erases`, the positive half, passes |

### Review fixes

The review found a regression, a cost and untested paths. Each new test was run
against the code it covers with that code cut, on 2026-10-08.

| Control: what was cut | Test | Where it failed |
| --- | --- | --- |
| The per-screen saved character sets (the branch before this fix, one slot for both screens) | `TestConform_AlternateScreen` | both cases where a save on the alternate screen must leave the primary screen's sets |
| The C1 check in the scanner's record of REP's character | `TestLastPrintedSkipsControls`, ghostty build | NEL and CSI sent as UTF-8 |
| The protection rotation in `rotateExt` | `TestConform_SelectiveErase` | IL, DL, and RI in a region |
| `moveProtected` | `TestConform_SelectiveErase` | IL and DL inside side margins |
| The protection clear in `FillArea` | `TestConform_SelectiveErase` | an erase in line unprotects the cells it erases |
| The protection clear in `blankRows` | `TestConform_SelectiveErase` | a line scrolled in at the bottom is not protected |
| The protection scroll in `scrollWindow` | `TestConform_SelectiveErase` | protection scrolls with its row |
| The protection shift in ICH, then in DCH | `TestConform_SelectiveErase` | protection moves with an insert, and with a delete |
| The height in `ApplyTerminalState`'s sizing (width only) | `TestWireNarrowsAWiderClient`, `TestGhosttyWireNarrowsAWiderClient` | every taller and bigger case, `line-feed-on-the-last-row` among them |
| `liveScreenLocked` always the main screen | `TestGhosttyWireCarriesTheCursorState` | `saved-on-each-screen` from a ghostty daemon, 4 subtests |
| The ghostty restore's switch always 1049 | `TestGhosttyWireCarriesTheCursorState` | `saved-on-each-screen` into a ghostty client, 4 subtests |
| `ResizeEmulatorToSnapshot` in `RestoreTerminalStates` | `TestRehydrationMatrix` | **not caught**: `ApplyTerminalState` sizes the emulator too, so the call only mirrors `primePaneFromDaemon` |

`TestGhosttyDivergence_ProtectionLost` pins two places the backends still
differ: a reflow drops protection on the pure emulator, and DECSTR stops it
there. Each case fails when the backends start to agree.

## herdr plugins on Windows (#579)

These are unit and platform-boundary tests in `internal/shimlink`,
`internal/herdrplugin` and `internal/stopevent`. No machine here runs Windows,
and Wine has no AF_UNIX, so no end-to-end test reaches this code. On
2026-10-09 each control below cut one piece of wiring, built the Windows test
binary, and ran the named test under Wine 10. The sweep control ran on Linux.
Every control failed where shown, and the same tests passed on the branch
build.

| Control: what was cut | Test | Where it failed |
| --- | --- | --- |
| The `withExtension` call in `ResolveProgram` | `TestResolveProgramOnThisPlatform` | `bin/herdr-nvim`, `./bin/herdr-nvim` and the absolute path all `plugin_command_not_found` |
| The job assignment in `track` (`if useJobs`) | `TestStopPluginKillsWhatTheCommandStarted` | the child of a running command still runs after `StopAll` |
| The job assignment in `track` (`if useJobs`) | `TestPluginProcessesEndWithTheDaemon` | the plugin's child still runs after the host is terminated |
| The `ntResumeProcess` call in `track` | `TestStartWithoutAJob` | the command never runs: no pid written in 20 s |
| The `setLimits(g.job, 0)` call in `release` | `TestAFinishedCommandLeavesItsProgramRunning` | the program a finished command opened is killed |
| The `Alive` check in `sweep` | `TestInstallFileSweepsLeftovers` | the running process's `.new-78` file is removed |
| The `ERROR_FILE_NOT_FOUND` case in `stopevent.Request` | `TestRequestReachesTheDaemon` | a request with no daemon returns "File not found", not `ErrNotWaiting` |

Two things are not caught:

- Cutting the `group.release()` call in the runner leaves every test green.
  The job then stays open with its kill-on-close limit, so a program a
  finished command opened ends with the daemon, and the handle leaks. No test
  ends the daemon after a command finishes.
- `TestInstallReplacesARunningLink` passes under Wine, but nothing shows that
  Wine refuses to replace a running program, so the rename-aside path may not
  run there. The test runs on real Windows in the `go test (windows)` job,
  which is the proof of that path.
## An xterm.js host gets images as glyphs (issue 567)

`TestCellBoundImageHostGetsGlyphs` runs tuios under `testdata/hostterm` with
`-xtversion`, so the host names itself the way Netcatty's xterm.js does.
tuitest's emulator answers the kitty query OK and lists sixel in DA1, so the
host claims both protocols. A pane draws a kitty picture, scrolls, and draws a
sixel picture. The xterm.js host must be sent no kitty graphics and no sixel,
and must show the sixel picture as glyphs on every one of its cells. The
positive half names the host kitty with the same probe and must get kitty
graphics and no glyphs, so a probe that never reads XTVERSION cannot pass.

The test runs in the standalone TUI and against a daemon. Two more cases play a
slow terminal: hostterm answers DA1 itself, 500 ms after the question, which is
after the startup probe gives up. In `xtermjs-late-da1` only DA1 is late. In
`xtermjs-late-both` and `xtermjs-late-both-daemon` XTVERSION is late too, so
only the program's input reader sees it.

Each control below was run on 2026-10-08 on branch `fix/kitty-image-ghosting`.

| Control | How | Tests that fail | Verdict |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| The probe does not drop graphics for xterm.js | `probeTerminal`: the `dropCellBoundGraphics(caps, response)` line cut | `TestCellBoundImageHostGetsGlyphs/xtermjs-standalone` and `/xtermjs-daemon` (kitty and sixel sent, 0 of 80 cells painted) | **caught** |
| Sixel is not pinned off | `dropCellBoundGraphics`: `caps.SixelPinned = true` cut | `TestCellBoundImageHostGetsGlyphs/xtermjs-late-da1` (the late DA1 turned sixel on: sixel sent, 0 of 80 cells painted) | **caught** |
| A late XTVERSION answer is not read | `OS.Update`: the `handleHostVersion(msg)` call cut | `TestCellBoundImageHostGetsGlyphs/xtermjs-late-both` and `/xtermjs-late-both-daemon` (kitty and sixel sent) | **caught** |
| The first fix only, before the late answer was handled | binary built from `cb0a899b` | `xtermjs-late-both` and `xtermjs-late-both-daemon` fail, `xtermjs-late-da1` passes | **caught** |

The SSH server path, where `sixelProbe` now asks XTVERSION as well as DA1, has
no e2e harness here. It was checked by hand: xterm.js 6.1 with its image addon,
in headless Chromium, connected to `tuios ssh` through a real `ssh`. Before the
change, `chafa` drew a sixel picture that stayed on screen after `clear`. After

## A link rides the ssh master a person opened

`TestLinkRidesTheSharedSSHMaster` gives the hub daemon one host, `build`,
reached through an ssh stand-in that records every argv it runs. With a
folder `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/tuios/cm` of mode 0700, the link's ssh and the ssh
of `tuios hosts test` must carry `ControlMaster=no` and
`ControlPath=<folder>/%C`, and the link must still come up. With no folder,
with a folder of mode 0777, and with an ssh config that gives the host a
`ControlPath` of its own, neither ssh may name the folder.

Each control below was run on 2026-10-08 on branch
`feat/link-shares-gui-ssh-master`. The log is
`~/.cache/agent-tmp/proof/v2/wave4/e2e/negative-controls-master.txt`.

| Control | How | Tests that fail | Verdict |

## The shared ssh master: review fixes

The unit tests are in `internal/federation/reuse_unix_test.go`. They guard
the security boundary and the timeout of the shared master folder.
`TestLinkRidesTheSharedSSHMaster` gains the case
`the_host_forwards_the_agent`: an ssh config that gives the host
`forwardagent yes` must keep the link's ssh off the folder.

Each control below was run on 2026-10-08 on branch
`feat/link-shares-gui-ssh-master`.

| Control | How | Tests that fail | Verdict |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

## The screen and scrollback from before tuios (discussion #588)

`TestExitKeepsTheHostScreen` starts tuios from a shell that has printed 60
lines, leaves it, and reads the host screen and the raw host stream. The exit
reset began with RIS (`ESC c`). RIS cleared the screen that leaving the
alternate screen had put back, and kitty and ghostty also drop the scrollback
on it. The fix replaces RIS with DECSTR, the soft reset. Run on 2026-10-09.

The positive half: each run waits until tuios has covered the 60 lines, and
asserts that tuios sent `CSI ? 1049 l`.

| Control: what was cut | Test | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| None: `main` at `8d3e07b9` | `standalone-quit`, `daemon-detach` | **caught**: the lines are gone, one RIS in each stream |
| The fix: `\033c` put back at the front of `ResetSequence` | `standalone-quit`, `daemon-detach` | **caught**: the same failures |
| `tape play`'s own copy of the reset | none | **not caught**: no test leaves `tape play` |
| `forceExit`, the reset after a wedged quit | none | **not caught**: no test wedges the client |

`TestExitTurnsOffWhatItTurnedOn` sets a bar cursor in a pane, quits from
terminal mode and from window management mode, and reads the last value of
each DEC private mode, the cursor style, the kitty keyboard flags,
modifyOtherKeys and the pointer shape in the host stream. Without RIS, each of
these needs its own reset. It passes on `main` too, because RIS is not in the
list it reads: it guards the explicit resets that now carry the load.

| Control: what was cut | Test | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `\033[?2031l` in `ResetSequence` | both subtests | **caught**: "tuios left DEC mode 2031 at h" |
| The OSC 22 reset in `ResetSequence` | none | **not caught**: no run moves the mouse, so tuios never sets a pointer shape |

## A worktree path the Inbox line cuts short

`TestRiskInWorktree` and `TestRiskInWorktreeRedacted` report a Claude Code
`Edit` of `demo/greet.py` inside a worktree that `worktree new` made under
`XDG_DATA_HOME`. One pane is the worktree session's own pane. The other is a
pane of another session that starts in the worktree. The Inbox line is clipped
to 100 characters, and in the second test a part of the path is also redacted
to `***`. The outside-the-worktree rule read what the line showed as the whole
path, and marked the call. The fix reads a path in the line only up to the cut
or the stars. Run on 2026-10-09.

The positive half: in the same daemon, an `Edit` of `/etc/hosts` is marked
`outside the worktree`. An `Edit` of a long path under `/etc` is marked
`outside the worktree` and `cut short`. Each test also checks that the line is
cut inside the worktree's path, so the case is not vacuous.

| Control: what was cut | Test | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| None: `main` at `937cc693` | both | **caught**: both panes are marked `outside the worktree` |
| `Shown: true` in `riskOfLine` | both | **caught**: the same failure |
| The `shownOutside` call in `outside` (always false) | `TestRiskInWorktree` | **caught**: the long `/etc` path is not marked `outside the worktree` |
| The `***` arm of the cut short mark in `riskOfLine` | `TestRiskInWorktree` | **caught**: `/etc/***.conf` is not marked `cut short` |

## A "..." that is not a clip mark

`TestRiskLineClipOnlyAtEnd` reports approval lines with `set-agent-state` from
a pane whose root is a linked worktree at a short path. The first fix cut a
path at any `...`. So `approve Write: <root cut 2 short>...` on a line that was
not clipped read as a path on the way into the worktree, and was not marked.
That failed open. The fix cuts a path at `...` only in the last word of a line
that `integration.Clipped` says was clipped. A `***` cuts a path in any word.
The test also covers a `...` in the middle of a clipped line, a clipped line
whose last word is not a path, a clipped line cut inside the root, and `***`
in a word before the last one. Run on 2026-10-09.

| Control: what was cut | Test | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| None: the first fix at `64c6df2d` | `TestRiskLineClipOnlyAtEnd` | **caught**: `lit-write`, `lit-mid` and `lit-mid-clip` are not marked `outside the worktree` |
| `Clipped: false` in `riskOfLine` | `TestRiskLineClipOnlyAtEnd` | **caught**: `clip-path`, cut inside the root, is marked `outside the worktree` |
| `Clipped: false` in `riskOfLine` | `TestRiskInWorktree` | **caught**: both panes mark the `Edit` inside the worktree `outside the worktree` |
| The `***` arm of `shownPart` | `TestRiskLineClipOnlyAtEnd` | **caught**: `mask-in` is marked `outside the worktree` |
## stream-pane, attach-presence and the size lease

`TestPhoneStreamsAPaneAndAnswersTheInbox` runs the real `tuios stdio-proxy
--as phone` and plays the phone on its stdin and stdout. On 2026-10-09 each
control below cut one line of wiring, built a binary, and ran the test
against it. Each control failed where shown, and the test passed on the
branch build. The transcript the test writes is
`stream-pane-transcript.txt` under `TUIOS_E2E_FRAMES`.

The positive halves: a made-up nonce gets `not_human` before the presence
nonce answers, `attach-presence` on a stream the hub did not vouch for gets
`forbidden` before a vouched stream gets a nonce, and the nonce of a closed
presence gets `not_human` before a new presence answers the same hold.

| Control: what was cut | Result |
| --- | --- |
| The presence clause in `matchHumanNonceClient` (`match := same && attach`) | **caught**: "the presence nonce did not answer the held approval", `not_human` |
| The `leasedSizeLocked` call in `PTY.Resize` | **caught**: "a resize under the lease changed the leased pane" |
| The lease release in `paneStream.close` | **caught**: "the pane did not go back to the size asked for" |
| The `decModes` call in `snapshotVT` | **caught**: "the snapshot did not set DEC mode 1" (and 2004, 1000, 1006, 66) |
| The alternate screen block in `snapshotVT` | **caught**: "the snapshot of a pane on the alternate screen: alt false" |
| The gap rebuild in `paneStream.stream` (the `recoverGap` call) | **caught**: the stream goes silent after the phone falls behind, "read a pane frame: stream read timed out" |

## stream-pane limits

`e2e/tui/stream_pane_limits_test.go` holds stream-pane to the limits around
its happy path. On 2026-10-09 each control below put back one line of the
review fixes, built a binary, and ran the test against it. Each control
failed where shown, and each test passed on the fixed build. The branch
before the fixes failed the same three tests the same way.

| Control: what was put back | Test | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `maxPaneInputFrame = 1 << 20` | `TestStreamPaneClientFrameMemory` | **caught**: "the daemon grew by 96 MiB for 96 streams" (fixed build: +0 MiB) |
| `PTY.SetLease` resizing on every call, with no `leaseInterval` | `TestStreamPaneLeaseChurn` | **caught**: "301 lease frames resized the pane 301 times in 1.73s" (fixed build: 2 times) |
| The `recheck` call in `paneStream.stream` left out | `TestStreamPaneFromAPane` | **caught**: "the stream outlived the read grant" |

`TestStreamPaneHeldToTheLinkPolicy` and `TestStreamPaneEndsWithItsWindow`
passed on the branch before the fixes. They hold behaviour the review
checked and found correct: input and lease frames from a peer without
`write` get `forbidden`, a presence nonce does not answer from a stream the
hub did not vouch for, and a stream ends with `X` when its window closes or
its session is killed. `TestStreamPaneLeaseOnTheDesktop` saves the frames
`stream-lease-held` and `stream-lease-released` under `TUIOS_E2E_FRAMES`: an
attached client draws the leased pane at 30 by 6 in its full rectangle, and at
58 by 36 again once the lease ends.

## stream-pane review fixes

`e2e/tui/stream_pane_review_test.go` holds the fixes from the review of the
stream-pane pull request. On 2026-10-09 each control below cut one line of a
fix, built a binary, and ran the test against it. Each control failed where
shown, and each test passed on the fixed build. The tests write
`presence-nonce-scope.txt`, `stream-lease-expiry.txt`,
`stream-lease-behind-input.txt` and `stream-snapshot-charge.txt` under
`TUIOS_E2E_FRAMES`.

| Control: what was cut | Test | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| The `covers` check in `humanNonceFor` (`if !ok \|\| !h.covers(sessionID)` to `if !ok`) | `TestPresenceNonceScope` | **caught**: "a presence for session phone answered in session other: reply-approval ... applied:true" |
| The `expireLease` call in `paneStream.stream` | `TestStreamPaneLeaseExpires` | **caught**: "the lease of a silent client did not end within 40s" (fixed build: `lease_expired` after 30s) |
| `queueInput` writing to the pane on the goroutine that reads the client | `TestStreamPaneLeaseBehindBlockedInput` | **caught**: "a lease frame behind input the pane does not read was not applied within 5s" |
| The read budget charge in `snapshotSubscribe` (charge 0) | `TestStreamPaneSnapshotCharged` | **caught**: "a second snapshot was taken while the first held the budget" (fixed build: `busy`) |

The positive halves: the scoped presence still acts in its own session, a
presence with no session answers the approval in the other session, a client
that renews its lease every 10 seconds keeps it past 30 seconds, input past
the queue gets `E busy`, and the budget frees once the first stream ends.
## agent-transcript and the transcript event

`TestPersonReadsAgentTranscript` joins a pane to a Claude Code transcript
fixture with the real `agent-hook claude-code` SessionStart, and reads it
through the real `tuios stdio-proxy --as phone` with a presence nonce. On
2026-10-09 each control below cut one line, built a binary, and ran the
test against it. Each control failed where shown, and the test passed on
the branch build. The artifact is `agent-transcript.txt` under
`TUIOS_E2E_FRAMES`.

The positive halves: before the read that works, a read without a nonce, a
made-up nonce, and the person's nonce on a stream the hub did not vouch for
get `not_human`. A link whose host lacks `respond` gets `forbidden`. A
process in the pane gets `forbidden` for its own presence and `not_human`
for a live local presence nonce.

| Control: what was cut | Result |
| --- | --- |
| The `humanNonceHeld` and `humanNonceFor` checks in `verbAgentTranscript` (rerun 2026-10-09 after the rebase onto nonce scope; with only `humanNonceHeld` cut, `humanNonceFor` still refuses, so it is not caught) | **caught**: "a read without a nonce: want not_human, got <nil>" |
| `respond` for `agent-transcript` in `verbCapabilities` (made `list`) | **caught**: "a link without respond: want forbidden naming respond, got <nil>" |
| The `noteTranscriptGrowth` call in `readAgentTranscript` | **caught**: "no transcript event: stream read timed out" |
| `foldResults` in `forward` | **caught**: "the appended call: want the text and a running Bash call" |
| The file id comparison in `parseCursor` | **caught**: "a made-up cursor: want reset with the newest entries" |
| The first record in `fileID` | **caught**: "a replaced file: want reset with its two entries", got `AFTER-REPLACE` alone with reset false |
| The secret mask in `transcriptText` | **caught**: the Bash call's target carries `sk-live-e2e-SECRET` |
| `ansi.Strip` in `transcriptText` | **caught**: the Bash result and the last answer carry `[31m` and `[2J` |

### A transcript directory deleted and made again

`TestTranscriptWatchOutlivesItsDirectory` joins two panes to transcripts in
one directory, deletes the directory, and makes it again. It then checks
that a new join in the directory and the old join both get `transcript`
events. On 2026-10-09 each build below ran the test. The test passed on the
fixed build three runs in a row. The artifact is `transcript-watch.txt` under
`TUIOS_E2E_FRAMES`.

| Control | Result |
| --- | --- |
| The watcher before the fix (`transcript_watcher.go` from `fb5d07fd`) | **caught**: "no transcript event: stream read timed out" for the new join |
| The `markLost` call cut from `TranscriptWatcher.run` | **caught**: "no transcript event: stream read timed out" for the new join |

### Paging back through a transcript with before

`TestPersonPagesBackThroughATranscript` reads a transcript of 80 entries from
its newest page back to its first with `before`, 7 entries a page. Each
record gives two entries, so pages end inside records. The pages joined
must equal one read of everything. On 2026-10-09 each build below ran the
test, and the test passed on the branch build. The artifact is
`transcript-pages.txt` under `TUIOS_E2E_FRAMES`.

| Control | Result |
| --- | --- |
| The branch before the change (no `before`, no `older`) | **caught**: "one read of everything: want 80 entries and no older", `older` missing |
| The filter that keeps only the entries before the cursor, cut from `back` | **caught**: "the pages joined" with entries twice |
| The record at a cursor inside a record left out of `back`'s window (`stop = next` cut) | **caught**: "page 10 is empty" |

### Diff colours for the phone

`TestPersonSeesDiffColours` reads edits of a Go file, a Python file and a
text file. It checks the `spans` and `words` of each diff line, in UTF-16
offsets, with a line that holds an emoji. Then it reads twelve Writes of a
300-line Go file and checks that only the newest has spans. On 2026-10-09
each build below ran the test, and the test passed on the branch build three
runs in a row. The artifact is `transcript-colours.txt` under
`TUIOS_E2E_FRAMES`.

| Control | Result |
| --- | --- |
| The branch before the change (no `spans`, no `words`) | **caught**: "the Go context line: want func as kd and greet as nf, got []" |
| Byte offsets sent in place of UTF-16 offsets (`utf16Index.at` returns its input) | **caught**: "a bad span {S:23 E:27 K:nx}" past the end of the emoji line |
| The pairing of removed and added lines cut from `styleHunk` | **caught**: "the changed words: want name at [20,24) and fullName at [20,28), got [] and []" |
| The budget check cut from `reader.style` | **caught**: "the colour budget: Write 0 (newest false) has plain false and 2700 spans" |

### agent-transcript review fixes

`agent_transcript_review_test.go` holds the review fixes of draft PR #603. On
2026-10-09 each control below cut one line, built a binary, and ran the named
test against it. Each control failed where shown. The same tests passed on
the branch build three runs in a row. The artifacts are under
`TUIOS_E2E_FRAMES`, one file for each test.

The positive halves: a presence for the pane's own session and a presence
with no session read the pane. The same local connection reads before it
restricts itself. A limit of 1 reads. A pane names its own transcript and is
joined. The newest edit of a page is matched. The `.env` keys, the `BEGIN`
and `END` lines and an ordinary Python edit stay in the reply.

| Control: what was cut | Test | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| The `humanNonceFor` check in `verbAgentTranscript` | `TestTranscriptNonceScope` | **caught**: "a presence for session other read session convo" |
| `agent-transcript` made `scopeOpen` in `verbScopes` | `TestTranscriptNonceScope` | **caught**: "a restricted connection: want forbidden, got not_human" |
| The limit check made `*p.Limit < 0` | `TestTranscriptNonceScope` | **caught**: "limit 0: want invalid_params, got <nil>" |
| The `transcriptPathAllowed` call in `joinReportedTranscript` | `TestTranscriptPathRules` | **caught**: "a path outside the projects folder: want transcript_refused" |
| The own-pane check in `joinReportedTranscript` | `TestTranscriptPathRules` | **caught**: "pane A named a transcript for pane B: want transcript_refused" |
| `transcript.OpenRegular` replaced by `os.Open` in `transcriptview.Read` | `TestTranscriptPathRules` | **caught**: the read after the FIFO swap: "stream read timed out" |
| `Unwatch` clears every callback of the path again (`clear(fns)`) | `TestTranscriptSharedFileWatch` | **caught**: "no transcript event: stream read timed out" |
| Every entry finished in `decode`, oldest first | `TestTranscriptDiffBudget` | **caught**: "limit 1: the newest edit: want it matched", got `whole_replace` true |
| The cells not taken from the budget in `lineDiff` | `TestTranscriptDiffBudget` | **caught**: "limit 2: the older edit: want a whole replace", got whole false |
| The `CleanLines` call in `addHunk` | `TestTranscriptMasksMultiLineSecrets` | **caught**: "a diff carries a secret ENVMARKER" |
| The `maskSecretLines` call in `transcriptText` | `TestTranscriptMasksMultiLineSecrets` | **caught**: "the Bash result carries a secret PEMBODYMARKER" |

Not caught here: the bound on memory for one call. `decode` keeps about
twice `limit` entries, and their text is cut before `Clean`, but no test
measures the daemon's memory. The diff controls above show that an entry the
page does not carry is not finished.
## Web Push to a phone

`TestWebPushToAPhone` runs a real daemon, a stub push service on loopback and
the phone link. The test is the phone. It registers with `register-push` and
the nonce of `attach-presence`. The real Claude Code hook holds an approval.
The test decrypts the push with its own RFC 8291 code, and checks the
payload, the headers and the VAPID JWT. Then it answers the approval and
decrypts the close. Run on 2026-10-09.

The positive halves: the same `register-push` with the person's nonce, over
the phone link, is taken. `tuios notify push register` outside every pane is
taken. A phone whose service answers 201 stays registered. The 503 phone gets
its push on the retry.

| Control: what was cut | Where it failed |
| --- | --- |
| The `n.web.note` call in `pushNotifier.note` | **caught**: no push to `/s/pixel` |
| The `requirePushPerson` call in `verbRegisterPush` | **caught**: a call with no nonce registers |
| `register-push` needs `list` instead of `respond` in the link policy | **caught**: the link without `respond` registers |
| The `ErrGone` arm in `webPusher.deliver` | **caught**: the phone whose service answered 410 is still listed |
| The retry in `webPusher.deliver` | **caught**: the payload the 503 refused never arrives |
| The pane check in `matchHumanNonceClient` | **not run**: it is the check `reply-approval` uses, and `TestAPaneCannotAnswerAsThePerson` and the stream-pane test cover it |

### Review: local addresses, redirects, a corrupt phones file

The security review of the branch found that `register-push` took an `https`
endpoint on any address. A linked machine with `respond` could aim the daemon
at this machine's loopback or network, and `list-push` told it what answered.
A push also followed a redirect on the same host, and tried a refused
redirect again. A phones file the daemon could not read was written over by
the next register. Run on 2026-10-09. The branch before the fixes fails all
three cases below.

`TestWebPushRefusesLocalAddresses` runs with no `allow_insecure`. It refuses
`https` to `127.0.0.1`, `[::1]`, `localhost`, `169.254.169.254` and
`0.0.0.0`. It registers `tuios-test.localhost`, a name that resolves to
loopback, and checks that the daemon never connects to the listener on that
port. The positive half is `TestWebPushToAPhone`: with `allow_insecure`, the
loopback stub gets every push, also at `http://127.0.0.1:<port>/up...?up=1`,
the endpoint shape an Android emulator gives through `adb reverse`.

`TestWebPushToAPhone` also registers a phone whose service answers 307, with
`notify.allow_http_redirects = true`. The redirect target must get nothing,
and no payload may arrive twice. `TestWebPushKeepsACorruptPhonesFile` starts
the daemon on an unreadable `subscriptions.json` and registers a phone.

| Control: what was put back | Test | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| The `hostAllowed` check cut from the `https` arm of `CheckEndpoint` | `TestWebPushRefusesLocalAddresses` | **caught**: "register-push to https://127.0.0.1:38833/s/x without allow_insecure: want invalid_params, got <nil>" |
| The dialer's `Control` hook never set | `TestWebPushRefusesLocalAddresses` | **caught**: "the daemon connected 1 times to a loopback address it reached by name" |
| The push client's `CheckRedirect` set to nil, so it follows | `TestWebPushToAPhone` | **caught**: "the push followed the redirect: /s/landed got 2 requests" |
| `CheckRedirect` refuses with an error, which retries | `TestWebPushToAPhone` | **caught**: "the push the redirect refused was tried again" |
| The rename cut from `webPusher.loadLocked` | `TestWebPushKeepsACorruptPhonesFile` | **caught**: "the unreadable phones file was not kept aside" |

### Review: nonce scope, Inbox items, secrets, padding, TTL

The second review of the branch asked for these fixes. Each control below
puts one fix back and runs `TestWebPushToAPhone`. Run on 2026-10-09, on the
branch rebased onto stream-pane at 26a474cc.

- A phone gets the Inbox of every session, so `register-push`, `list-push`
  and `remove-push` are an act in no one session. A presence made for one
  session can not do them.
- The VAPID `sub` is `https://tuios.dev/push` on every machine. The push
  service reads the JWT, and the old default named the machine.
- Each registration opens the Inbox item `phone NAME`, and says when it
  replaced a phone of that name. A link can not replace a phone. A removal
  over a link and a 404 or 410 from the push service open the item too.
- `tuios notify push register` reads the subscription from a file or stdin.
  The command line takes none of its secrets.
- Each payload is padded to 256, 512, 1024, 2048 or 3072 bytes.
- The open and the close of `approval`, `plan`, `ask` and `question` have a
  TTL of 3600 seconds.
- A payload past 3 KiB is cut, not dropped, and its options stay. The JSON
  has no HTML escapes.

The positive halves are in the same test: the unscoped presence registers,
lists and removes; the CLI registers from stdin; the person replaces `desk`
on this machine; every other push arrives and decrypts.

| Control: what was put back | Result |
| --- | --- |
| The `humanNonceFor` check cut from `requirePushPerson` | **caught**: "register-push with a presence made for one session: want not_human for another session, got <nil>" |
| The default subject with the host name after it | **caught**: "JWT sub "https://tuios.dev/push/HOST", want https://tuios.dev/push, with no machine name (HOST) in it" |
| The `notePhone` call cut from `verbRegisterPush` | **caught**: "no Inbox item about phone desk says "by this machine"" |

| The `notePhone` call cut from the `ErrGone` arm | **caught**: "no Inbox item about phone old says "no longer knows this phone"" |
| The `notePhone` call cut from a remove over a link | **caught**: "no Inbox item about phone pixel says "Removed from Web Push by the link from phone"" |
| The `--endpoint`, `--p256dh` and `--auth` flags put back | **caught**: "notify push register took the subscription's secrets on the command line" |
| `PaddedSize` returns the length unpadded | **caught**: "the push to /s/pixel pads a 221-byte payload to 221 bytes, not to a bucket" |
| `pushTTLWaiting` set back to 120 | **caught**: the open's headers show `Ttl:120`, and "the close of an approval has TTL "120", want 3600 like its open" |
| The old `fitPayload`: `json.Marshal` with HTML escapes, and options dropped to fit | **caught**: "the ask's push lost its options: got <nil>" |

The RFC 8291 Appendix A example is a wire compatibility test in
`internal/pushnotify` (`TestEncryptRFC8291AppendixA`). With the delimiter
`0x02` changed to `0x01` it fails.
## tuios pair

`e2e/tui/pair_test.go` acts as the phone against a real `tuios pair`. It
reads the link, makes the MAC, posts the key and checks the reply.
`TestPairedKeyOpensOnlyTheLink` then logs in with the installed key through a
scratch sshd (its own host key, port and authorized keys file, run as the
user) and links a second daemon through it. `TestPairQRCodeHoldsTheLink`
decodes the drawn code with `zbarimg`.

Each control below was run on 2026-10-09 on branch `feat/pair`. The logs are
in `~/.cache/agent-tmp/pair/neg/`.

| Control: what was cut | Tests that fail | Verdict |
| --- | --- | --- |
| The MAC check | `TestPairRefusesWrongRequests/wrong_mac`, `/swapped_key` (status 200, the key is written) | **caught** |
| `command="..."` in the installed line | `TestPairAddsAPhoneKey` (the line), `TestPairedKeyOpensOnlyTheLink` (ssh runs `echo NOT-FORCED`, and typing goes through) | **caught** |
| `restrict` in the installed line | `TestPairedKeyOpensOnlyTheLink` (`ssh -R` keeps running) | **caught** |
| `--as DEVICE` in the forced command | `TestPairedKeyOpensOnlyTheLink` (send-text goes through: the hub's own name gets the default policy) | **caught** |
| The token is spent on success | `TestPairAddsAPhoneKey` (the code pairs a second key) | **caught** |
| The timeout | `TestPairCodeExpires` (tuios pair does not end) | **caught** |
| The 8 KiB body cap | `TestPairRefusesWrongRequests/oversize_body` (status 200) | **caught** |
| The key type check | `TestPairAddsAPhoneKey` (an RSA 2048 key is written) | **caught** |
| The device name check | `TestPairAddsAPhoneKey` (`../evil` is written) | **caught** |
| The duplicate key check | `TestPairLeavesWhatIsThereAlone` (status 200, the file changes) | **caught** |
| The case-blind `[hosts]` table check | `TestPairLeavesWhatIsThereAlone` (`[hosts.phone]` is added beside `[hosts.Phone]`) | **caught** |
| The limit of wrong requests | `TestPairStopsAfterTooManyWrongRequests` (a good request after three wrong ones pairs) | **caught** |
| The limit set to 4 in place of 3 | `TestPairStopsAfterTooManyWrongRequests` (the same) | **caught** |
| The reply MAC over `tuios-pair-v1-ok` | `TestPairAddsAPhoneKey` (the reply MAC does not match) | **caught** |
| The QR code holds the printed link | `TestPairQRCodeHoldsTheLink/colour`, `/plain` (the link plus `x`) | **caught** |
| The `--listen-all` check | `TestPairListensOnlyWhereTheCodeSays` (`0.0.0.0:0`, `[::]:0` and `:0` run) | **caught** |
| The `--listen-all` warning | `TestPairListensOnlyWhereTheCodeSays` (no warning) | **caught** |
| The default binds each found address | `TestPairListensOnlyWhereTheCodeSays` (bound to `0.0.0.0` gives a listener on `[::]`) | **caught** |
| The question before the key is added | `TestPairAsksBeforeItAddsTheKey/n` (the key is written after `n`), `/y` (no question) | **caught** |
| The constant-time compare (`hmac.Equal`) | none | **not caught**: an end-to-end test cannot measure the timing |

### tuios pair: security review fixes

Each control below was run on 2026-10-09 on branch `feat/pair`. Each one
builds `cmd/tuios` with one fix taken out and runs the test that covers it.
The build from `bd0316ed`, before the fixes, fails the same tests. The logs
are in `~/.cache/agent-tmp/pair-review/neg/`.

| Control: what was cut | Tests that fail | Verdict |
| --- | --- | --- |
| The write deadline for the reply in `serveConn` | `TestPairReplyReachesAPhoneAfterASlowAnswer` (a `y` after 13 seconds: the phone gets EOF, and the key is written) | **caught** |
| The stop check before the key write, and the stop case in `confirm` | `TestPairStopDuringTheQuestionWritesNothing` (a `y` after Ctrl+C writes the key and the phone gets ok, while tuios says pairing is stopped) | **caught** |
| The check of the bound address in `openPairListeners` | `TestPairListensOnlyWhereTheCodeSays` (`--listen 0:0` runs on `[::]` without `--listen-all`) | **caught** |
| Skipping a connection closed before its first byte | `TestPairIgnoresConnectionsClosedUnused` (the fourth connection is refused: three unused ones stopped the pairing) | **caught** |
| `checkAuthorizedKeysModes` | `TestPairRefusesAKeysFileAnyoneCanWrite` (a file and a folder with mode 0666 and 0777 get a code; a 0660 file gives no warning) | **caught** |
| The one-line check of the key field | `TestPairAddsAPhoneKey` (`"not a key\n"+KEY` gets 200 and is written) | **caught** |

`TestPairIgnoresConnectionsClosedUnused` waits 400 ms between connections.
With 100 ms, the build before the fix passed: a wrong request holds the
listener for its 200 ms pause, so some connections got 429 and were not
counted.

### tuios pair: second review

Each control below was run on 2026-10-09 on branch `feat/pair`. Each one
builds `cmd/tuios` with one fix taken out and runs the tests named. The logs
are in `~/.cache/agent-tmp/pair-r2/neg/`. The build from `874cf2d2`, before
these fixes, fails every test named here. Part of that is the
`--accept-local` flag, which the test helpers pass and that build does not
have.

| Control: what was cut | Tests that fail | Verdict |
| --- | --- | --- |
| The stop when the `[hosts.DEVICE]` write fails | `TestPairWritesThePolicyBeforeTheKey` (config.toml is read-only: the key is written, the phone gets 200) | **caught** |
| The default `allow` of `list, mail` without `--allow` | `TestPairAsksBeforeItAddsTheKey/n`, `/y` (no allow list in the question, no `[hosts.pixel-9]` table) | **caught** |
| `pairNameInUse`, at the request and for `--name` | `TestPairRefusesANameInUse`, `TestPairLeavesWhatIsThereAlone` (the name of `[hosts.Phone]` gets 500 and stops the pairing, not 409) | **caught** |
| The names that pinned keys in authorized_keys use | `TestPairRefusesANameInUse` (`tablet` pairs beside a key pinned as `Tablet`, and `--name TABLET` shows a code) | **caught** |
| The allow list in the question | `TestPairAsksBeforeItAddsTheKey/n`, `/y` | **caught** |
| The refusal of this machine's addresses | `TestPairRefusesRequestsFromThisMachine/loopback`, `/own_lan_address` (200, the key is written) | **caught** |
| The refusal of the addresses of `[hosts]` | `TestPairRefusesRequestsFromThisMachine/host_in_config` (200 with `--accept-local`, the key is written) | **caught** |
| `check` in the reply | `TestPairAddsAPhoneKey` (the reply check code is empty) | **caught** |
| The check code in the question | `TestPairAsksBeforeItAddsTheKey/n`, `/y` | **caught** |
| The `tuios` on PATH in the forced command | `TestPairForcedCommandUsesTheTuiosOnPath/link_on_path` (the command names the file the link points to) | **caught** |
| The public address check before the bind | `TestPairListensOnlyWhereTheCodeSays` (`--listen 8.8.8.8:0` fails at the bind, with no word of `--listen-all`) | **caught** |
| Counting only pairing requests with a wrong MAC | `TestPairCountsOnlyPairingRequests` (three requests that are not pairing requests stop the listener) | **caught** |
| The folders above the authorized keys folder, up to the home folder | `TestPairChecksTheHomeFolder/anyone`, `/group` (a home with mode 0777 gets a code, 0770 gives no warning) | **caught** |
| The public address check for addresses tuios finds | none | **not caught**: the test machine has no public address to find |
| The DNS and tailnet lookups of `[hosts]` addresses | none | **not caught**: the tests give an IP in `addr`. A name needs a resolver or a tailnet the test controls |
