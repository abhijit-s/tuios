# The tmux shim

There is no tmux in a tuios pane, so a tool that opens its workers in tmux panes,
such as Claude Code agent teams, cannot. Run it under the shim and its `tmux`
calls answer in this session instead:

```sh
tuios tmux-shim -- env CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1 claude
```

Each teammate then opens as a tuios pane on your workspace, named after it, with
its agent state on the rail and in the Inbox. The shim is opt-in: only what you
start under `tuios tmux-shim` sees it. With no command it starts your shell,
and every `tmux` call from that shell goes to the shim.

## What it answers

A tmux window is a workspace (`@N`) and a pane is a tuios window (`%N`). It
answers `split-window`, `new-window`, `send-keys`, `capture-pane -p`,
`display-message -p`, `list-panes`, `list-windows`, `list-sessions`,
`list-clients`, `detach-client` (needs `admin`), `has-session`, `kill-pane`, `kill-window`, `select-pane`,
`last-pane`, `select-window`, `next-window`, `previous-window`,
`rename-window`, `rename-session`, `break-pane`, `join-pane`, `move-pane`,
`respawn-pane -k`, `display-popup` (so `fzf --tmux` works), `run-shell`,
`if-shell`, `wait-for` (channels and locks), the paste buffer commands (on the
daemon's buffers, so `tmux paste-buffer` pastes the person's last yank),
`show-environment`, `set-environment` and `show-options`. A command can be
shortened to any prefix that names one command, and formats take tmux 3.4's
modifiers (`#{=10:pane_title}`, `#{?cond,a,b}`, `#{s/a/b/:...}`).

Layout and style commands succeed and do nothing, since tuios owns the layout.
Split flags such as `-h` and `-l` are accepted and do not change where a pane
goes. The one option it sets is `window-size smallest|largest|latest`, the
session's `daemon.window_size`. `swap-pane` is refused. `new-session -d` works
outside a pane and is refused inside one. `tmux -C` and `-CC` start a control
client, whose `%output` lines carry no bytes: read the pane with
`capture-pane`. Anything else fails rather than pretending.

Ask it one question directly, from any tuios pane:

```sh
tuios tmux display-message -p '#{pane_id} #{window_id} #{tuios_window_id}'
tuios tmux list-panes -F '#{pane_id} #{pane_title}'
```

A call whose `TMUX` or `-S` names a real tmux server still goes to the real tmux
on `PATH`.

## What it can reach

It never reaches another session: every target resolves inside the caller's
own. It is held to your pane's grants: opening, closing, focusing and naming
panes, showing or naming a workspace, and respawning any pane but your own
need `admin` (`tuios pane-grants` shows what you hold). It is not a
sandbox; for an agent held to its own session, use `tuios mcp` or give its pane
fewer grants.

## When a tool does not work under it

Calls the shim could not fully answer are recorded, as JSON lines, in
`$XDG_STATE_HOME/tuios/tmux-shim.log` (the platform's state directory when that
is unset), or the file `--log` names. `--log-all` records every call. The log
never records what was typed.

```sh
tuios tmux-shim --log-all --log /tmp/shim.log -- mytool
tail -5 /tmp/shim.log
```

Prefer the tuios verbs for your own work; the shim is for tools that only know
tmux.
