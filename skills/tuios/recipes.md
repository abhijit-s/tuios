# Recipes

Each recipe is a whole job, end to end, using only commands described in the
other topics. Change the names and prompts; keep the order.

## A sessionizer

Open a project as a session: pick a folder, and switch to its session, made in
that folder when it is missing. As a command key in `config.toml`, in a popup:

```toml
[[keybindings.command]]
key = "prefix+alt+s"
type = "popup"
command = 'dir=$(find ~/dev -mindepth 1 -maxdepth 1 -type d | fzf) && tuios switch-session --create --cwd "$dir" "$(basename "$dir")"'
description = "Open a project"
```

The popup is a pane, so `switch-session` moves the client that shows it. Put
`build:` before the name to open the project on a host.

## A fleet of agents on one task

Three agents, each in its own worktree, allowed to work in their own sessions
and nowhere else, then the best result kept:

```sh
tuios fan 3 --agent claude --grants read,write --name fan/retry 'Add a retry with backoff to the HTTP client. Run the tests before you stop.'
tuios list-agents --select 'group:fan/retry'
tuios wait-for agent-state --select 'group:fan/retry' --until idle,done,errored --every --timeout 3600000
tuios worktree ls --group fan/retry
tuios fan compare api-fan-retry
tuios fan verify api-fan-retry -- go test ./...
tuios worktree diff api-fan-retry-2 --stat
tuios review note -s api-fan-retry-2 api/retry.go:42 'log the attempt number here too'
tuios review send -s api-fan-retry-2
tuios fan keep api-fan-retry-2 --stash
```

While they run, anything that needs the person (an approval, a question, a
first-run choice that held the prompt) is in the Inbox. To tell the whole fleet
something, message it by selector; the first call lists the panes and the token:

```sh
tuios list-agents --select 'group:fan/retry'
tuios send-agent-message --select 'group:fan/retry' --confirm TOKEN 'main moved; rebase before you finish'
```

Use `ask-agent --select ... --yes` only for a question any match may answer.

## Answering from the Inbox

For the person. Every approval, question, error, finished turn and message from
every session and machine is one list:

1. Press the prefix key then `i` to open it, or the prefix key then `o` to go
   straight to the oldest item.
2. `j` and `k` move. `/` narrows the list with a selector such as
   `harness:codex needs:you`.
3. On an approval or a question, `space` shows the prompt as the pane shows it.
   A digit chooses that option, `a` approves, `A` approves and does not ask
   again, `d` denies, `tab` types a free answer.
4. On mail, `r` replies. The reply reaches the agent marked `verified_human`.
5. `enter` goes to the pane instead.

For an agent: make your prompts answerable from there. Report `needs_input`
with `--kind` and a message that is the question, keep the harness's numbered
options on screen, and ask decisions with `ask-human` rather than a free-form
message.

```sh
tuios set-agent-state needs_input -s "$TUIOS_SESSION" -w "$TUIOS_PANE_ID" --kind question -m 'drop the v1 endpoint?'
answer=$(tuios ask-human 'Drop the v1 endpoint?' -o drop -o keep --timeout 90000)
```

## Approvals without going to the pane

To answer Claude Code's, Qwen Code's, opencode's or Kilo's permission prompts
from the Inbox with `1` (once), `2` (always) or `3` (deny), the person adds this to
config.toml and installs the integration:

```toml
[agents.approvals]
enabled = ["claude-code"]
hold_seconds = 120
```

```sh
tuios integration install claude-code
tuios doctor agents
```

Only a call the Inbox can show whole on one line is held; the rest are asked in
the pane. A held pane shows nothing on screen: wait on its state, not its
screen. For a headless agent (`start-agent --protocol`) the Inbox holds such
requests with no config.

## Agents on another machine

Run the work on a bigger machine, watch it here, and bring the result back:

```sh
tuios hosts add build gaurav@buildbox
tuios hosts test build
tuios fan 2 --host build --agent claude 'Profile the importer and make it faster.'
tuios list-agents --all-hosts --select 'host:build'
tuios list-attention --host build
tuios worktree ls --host build
tuios worktree pull build:api-fan-profile-importer-2
```

Run `fan --host` from inside your checkout: the repository is found on the other
machine by its origin URL (`--clone` clones it there). `worktree pull` makes a
new worktree session here with the commits and the uncommitted work, and changes
nothing there. That machine's `[hosts]` policy decides what this one may do;
a refusal is `forbidden`.

## MCP instead of shell commands

```sh
tuios integration install claude-code --mcp
tuios integration status claude-code
```

Restart the harness in a tuios pane. It then has `tuios_list_agents`,
`tuios_wait_for`, `tuios_send_agent_message` and the rest, reaching only its own
session and fan group. Use `--mcp-write` only for an agent that must type into
panes. `tuios --skill mcp` lists every tool.

## Claude Code agent teams in tuios panes

```sh
tuios tmux-shim -- env CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1 claude
```

Each teammate opens as a named pane on your workspace, with its state on the
rail. If a teammate does not appear, the pane lacks `admin`
(`tuios pane-grants`), or the tool used a tmux command the shim does not answer:
run it with `--log-all` and read the log (`tuios --skill tmux`).

## Scoped grants for a fleet

For the person: make every pane start with less, and give more only where it is
needed. In config.toml:

```toml
[agents.permissions]
mode = "strict"
grants = ["read", "write", "fan"]
```

Then a read-only reviewer, and one supervisor allowed to approve its workers'
prompts:

```sh
tuios start-agent claude --name reviewer --grants read
tuios set-pane-grants -w supervisor --grants read,write,fan,respond
tuios pane-grants
```

A pane can give only what it holds and never raise its own grants, and only the
person can give `respond`. From inside an agent's pane, `tuios pane-grants`
shows what it holds.

## A conductor

A pane that hands the next task to each agent that finishes, and leaves
everything else in the Inbox for the person. It never answers a prompt: it holds
no `respond`, and approvals are the person's.

```sh
#!/bin/sh
# conductor.sh: run in a tuios pane beside the fleet. tasks.txt holds one task per line.
tuios subscribe --types attention | while read -r ev; do
  [ "$(printf '%s' "$ev" | jq -r '.action')" = open ] || continue
  [ "$(printf '%s' "$ev" | jq -r '.attention.kind')" = finished ] || continue
  sess=$(printf '%s' "$ev" | jq -r '.attention.session')
  win=$(printf '%s' "$ev" | jq -r '.attention.window')
  task=$(head -n 1 tasks.txt)
  if [ -z "$task" ]; then
    tuios send-agent-message -s "$TUIOS_SESSION" -w human --from "$TUIOS_PANE_ID" 'every task is handed out'
    continue
  fi
  tail -n +2 tasks.txt > tasks.next && mv tasks.next tasks.txt
  tuios ask-agent -s "$sess" -w "$win" --from "$TUIOS_PANE_ID" "$task" &
done
```

Give the conductor only what it needs: `--grants read,write,fan` from the pane
that starts it. `ask-agent` refuses a pane on `needs_input`, so a task never
lands on a prompt. If the stream drops, start it again with `--after-seq` and
`--boot-id` from the last event (`tuios --skill events`). Do not make a
conductor reply to mail automatically without a bound: that is how two agents
loop.

## An alert on your phone

The `[notify]` table sends an Inbox item to ntfy, Pushover or a webhook, with
no script. It holds a notification while the person types at an attached
client, and the link opens tuios-web on the item. `tuios notify test` checks
each provider (`tuios --skill notify`):

```toml
[notify]
web_url = "https://term.example.com/"

[notify.ntfy]
url = "https://ntfy.sh/your-private-topic"
```

For your own message, use a hook. The daemon runs `after-agent-state` even
with nobody attached, so a hook can push to your phone when an agent needs
you. With ntfy:

```sh
#!/bin/sh
# ~/.config/tuios/hooks/phone.sh
curl -s -m 5 -H "Title: tuios: $TUIOS_AGENT_STATE" \
  -d "$TUIOS_SESSION_ID/$TUIOS_WINDOW_NAME is $TUIOS_AGENT_STATE" \
  https://ntfy.sh/your-private-topic > /dev/null
```

```toml
[hooks]
after-agent-state = ["sh ~/.config/tuios/hooks/phone.sh"]

[notifications.agent]
suppress_focused = true      # nothing for the pane you are looking at
quiet_hours = "23:00-07:00"
```

`[notifications.agent.states]` decides which states alert (`needs_input`,
`errored` and `done` by default), and `settle_seconds` drops a state the pane
left quickly. `suppress_focused` holds back only while the person can be
looking: once every attached client's terminal has reported losing focus, the
shown pane alerts too. The hook sends the pane's name and state, not its message, since
the message leaves your machine. The daemon reads `[hooks]` when it starts, so
this applies from the next daemon start; `tuios list-hooks` shows whether it
ran and what it returned.
