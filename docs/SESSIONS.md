# Sessions

TUIOS runs in one of two modes: a daemon session that lives in a background
process and survives the client that draws it, and a local session that lives
and dies with the process you started. A plain `tuios` gives you a daemon
session. This document covers both, what attaching and detaching do, and exactly
what does and does not come back after each kind of interruption.

> **Note:** `Ctrl+B` is the default leader key throughout. It is configurable via
> `leader_key`, see [CONFIGURATION.md](CONFIGURATION.md).

## Local Sessions

```bash
tuios --standalone
```

A local session keeps everything, the window manager, the terminal emulators and
the shell processes, inside one process. No daemon is started, no socket is
created and no state is written to disk. When the process exits, for any reason,
the session is gone: there is nothing to attach to and nothing to restore.

Local sessions are the right choice when you want a window manager for the
lifetime of one terminal window. Everything in this document from
[Attaching and Detaching](#attaching-and-detaching) onward applies only to
daemon sessions.

Ask for a local session in one of three ways:

```bash
tuios --standalone           # this one run
TUIOS_NO_DAEMON=1 tuios      # every tuios in this shell
```

```toml
[startup]
daemon = false               # every tuios, from the config file
```

The flag and the environment variable both beat the config file. They are the
way back to a terminal when the daemon is the thing that will not start.

## Daemon Sessions

```bash
tuios
```

Running `tuios` with no subcommand attaches to a daemon-backed session, and
starts the daemon first if none is running. This is `startup.daemon`, and it
ships on. A daemon that will not start does not leave you without a terminal:
`tuios` says so and runs the session standalone for that one run.

An install that already has a config file keeps what that file says. The
`[startup]` booleans are only read from the file, so `tuios` on an existing
machine goes on doing what it did.

A daemon session lives in a separate `tuios` daemon process. The daemon owns the
shell processes (PTYs) and runs a terminal emulator for each one, so output keeps
being parsed whether or not anyone is watching. A client is only a viewer: it
subscribes to PTY output, draws it, and forwards your keystrokes back.

```bash
tuios new mysession          # create a persistent session and attach to it
tuios new mysession --detach # create it headless, attach later
tuios attach mysession       # attach to an existing session
tuios attach                 # attach to the most recent session
tuios attach mysession -c    # attach, creating the session if it is missing
tuios ls                     # list live sessions
tuios ls --json              # the same list, machine readable
tuios kill-session mysession # terminate a session and all its windows
```

The daemon starts automatically when you create or attach to a session. You can
also run it explicitly:

```bash
tuios daemon                 # run in the foreground (useful for debugging)
tuios daemon --log-level=messages
tuios kill-server            # stop the daemon and all its sessions
```

`tuios kill-server` is synchronous. It returns only after every session's state
has been written and the daemon's socket has been removed, so a new daemon can
be started as soon as it returns.

More than one client can be attached to the same session at once. All of them
see the same windows and output. `window_size` in `[daemon]` sets the size of
the session. See [Session size with more than one client](#session-size-with-more-than-one-client).

Every attached client has full control: it sees all output, sends input, and
manipulates windows. There is no per-client permission tier, so share a session
only with people you would hand the keyboard to. Local clients are gated by the
socket's Unix permissions (same user only), SSH clients by SSH authentication,
and web clients by whatever stands in front of `tuios-web`. See
[Multi-client sessions](https://tuios.dev/docs/sessions) on the site for
the full picture.

### Session size with more than one client

A pane has one size, so a session has one size for all of its clients.
`window_size` in `[daemon]` selects the client that sets it. The values are
the values of the tmux `window-size` option.

- `smallest` is the default. The session uses the smallest client. Every
  client shows the full session. A larger client shows empty space around it.
- `largest`: the session uses the largest client.
- `latest`: the session uses the client that last had input.

For `latest`, input is a key, a paste, a click, a drag or a turn of the mouse
wheel. A resize is not input. A focus change is not input. A reply that your
terminal sends without you, such as a colour reply, is not input. tmux counts a
resize and a focus change. tuios does not, so a phone that only attaches does
not take the session from the person who types on a laptop.

A client keeps the session for 1 second after its last input. If two people
type at the same time, the session does not change size on each key. When one
person stops, the session goes to the other client 1 second after the last
key of the first.

The first client that attaches sets the size until another client has input.
When the latest client detaches, the session goes to the client with the most
recent input.

A client that is smaller than the session shows a part of it, the part around
the cursor of the focused pane. This is the rule that tmux uses. In copy mode
the client follows the copy-mode cursor. If a program hides its cursor, the
client follows the place where the program left it. An agent CLI hides its
cursor and leaves it in its input box, so you see the input box. tmux shows
the top left corner of the window instead.

A mark at the right end of the line above the dock shows the size of the
session, with arrows that point to the parts you cannot see. This line covers
no pane. With the dock hidden, the mark is in the bottom right corner of the
panes. The rail and the dock stay at the edges of your screen. A click on a
pane goes to the pane under the pointer, also in capture mode. The copy-mode
search prompt and the multi copy "Save to" prompt stay on your screen.

To change the value for one session while it runs:

```bash
tuios set-config daemon.window_size latest -s mysession
tuios session-info -s mysession --json   # window_size, session_width, session_height
```

Under the tmux shim, `tmux set -g window-size latest` does the same.

A client from a version of tuios before `window_size` cannot show a part of a
session. While such a client is attached, the session uses `smallest`, and
`session-info` reports `window_size` as `smallest`. A new client attached to
an older daemon works as before, at the smallest size.

Native clients, `tuios-web` clients and clients through the SSH server all
report input in the same way, so each of them can be the latest client.

A client that cannot send input, such as `tuios-web --read-only`, does not set
the size under `largest` or `latest`. A viewer with a large browser window
does not make the session larger than the people who type can see. Under
`smallest` it counts like every other client, so the default does not change.
If only viewers are attached, they set the size. A tool
that uses the verb socket only, such as Collie, is not a client with a size.
It does not change the size of the session.

### The sidebar with more than one client

The sidebar is part of the session. When you show or hide it on one client,
every client of the session shows or hides it. The panes then take the new
space on every client.

A new session takes the sidebar setting of the first client that attaches,
from `appearance.sidebar.enabled`. A later client with a different setting
uses the session's value. When you toggle the sidebar, tuios also keeps the
new value in your config for the next new session. A reload of the config
file does not change the sidebar of a session that is running.

The width of the sidebar stays per client. A client too narrow to show the
sidebar does not change it for the session. When the clients use different
widths, the panes use the space next to the widest sidebar. A client with a
narrower sidebar shows the difference as empty space.

A client from a version of tuios before this change keeps its sidebar to
itself. A new client attached to an older daemon also keeps its sidebar to
itself.

### In-app session switching

`Ctrl+B` `S` opens the session switcher. Type to fuzzy-filter, `Enter` to switch
to the highlighted session, `Ctrl+D` to delete one (with a confirmation prompt,
and never the session you are currently on). If your query matches no existing
session, `Enter` creates a session with that name and switches to it.

`Ctrl+R` renames the highlighted session. The rename changes the session's
name in the daemon, so `tuios ls`, `tuios attach` and every client show the
new name. The rail's rename and the `tuios rename-session` command do the
same. Panes that already run keep the old name in `TUIOS_SESSION`, and tuios
commands from them still reach the session. `tuios attach` and
`tuios kill-session` with the old name fail and name the new one. An event
stream on the session keeps its events under the new name. A name that another
session has is refused. A name that a saved session has is refused too.

With remote hosts in `[hosts]`, the switcher also lists the sessions on your
other machines. A remote session shows as `name @ host`, and the filter
matches that text. `Enter` switches to it, and back again, in either
direction. The rail, the palette and session cycling switch across machines
the same way. Rename and delete work only on sessions on the machine you are
on.

`tuios switch-session` switches a client from the command line, also from a
pane. See [Sessionizer](#sessionizer).

Switching is not the same as detaching and reattaching: the client tears down
its view of the current session and builds a view of the target, in place. The
session you left keeps running.

## Attaching and Detaching

**Detach:** `Ctrl+B` `d`. The client pushes its current state to the daemon so
the session you come back to is the one you left, then quits. The session, its
windows and its shell processes keep running.

**Quit:** `Ctrl+B` `q`. This is not a detach. In a daemon session, quitting kills
the session, on the reasoning that quitting is the user saying the session is
over. A confirmation dialog appears first if a window is running a foreground
process; set `confirm_quit = true` to always show it.

**Exit terminal mode:** `Ctrl+B` `Esc`, or `Alt+Esc` as a direct shortcut. A
bare `Esc` in terminal mode is forwarded to the shell, as it must be for vim and
friends to work. Note that `Ctrl+B` `d` exits terminal mode only when there is no
daemon session to detach from; in a daemon session it detaches.

A client that dies without detaching (its terminal is closed, the SSH connection
drops, the process is killed) is equivalent to a detach as far as the session is
concerned. The daemon notices the connection go away and keeps the session
running. Nothing is lost, because nothing the session needs lived in the client.

## Sessionizer

A sessionizer opens a project as a session. You pick a folder, and tuios
shows its session. When the session does not exist, tuios makes it in that
folder first.

Add this command key to `config.toml`. It opens a popup with `fzf` over the
folders in `~/dev`:

```toml
[[keybindings.command]]
key = "prefix+alt+s"
type = "popup"
command = 'dir=$(find ~/dev -mindepth 1 -maxdepth 1 -type d | fzf) && tuios switch-session --create --cwd "$dir" "$(basename "$dir")"'
description = "Open a project"
```

Press `Ctrl+B` `Alt+S`, pick a folder, and press `Enter`. The client switches
to the session of that folder. Its windows start in the folder.

- [`tuios switch-session`](CLI_REFERENCE.md#tuios-switch-session) switches
  the client that shows the popup. Nothing is nested.
- `--create` makes the session when it is missing. `--cwd` sets the folder
  of its windows. The session keeps this folder after a daemon restart.
- With `startup.tiled = true`, the new session is tiled. tuios reads this
  setting from the config of the client that switches. This is also true
  for a session on a host.
- To open a project on a host, put the host before the name:
  `tuios switch-session --create --cwd "$dir" "build:$(basename "$dir")"`.
  The folder is a path on that host.

From a shell outside tuios, name the client with `-s`:

```sh
tuios switch-session -s work --create --cwd ~/dev/api api
```

To make a session without a switch, run `tuios new NAME --detach --cwd DIR`.

## The Scratch Terminal

`Ctrl+B` `g` shows the scratch terminal in a box over the current layout.
Press `Ctrl+B` `g` again to hide it. tmux-floax does the same for tmux.

The scratch terminal is a small layout of its own. It starts as one shell. You
can split it into more panes, and move, resize and zoom them, as on a
workspace. The key shows and hides all of its panes together. For example, keep
log tails of three services and a shell for tests in the scratch terminal, and
go back to your code with one key.

Hiding does not close a pane. Each shell keeps running with its scrollback. The
next `Ctrl+B` `g` shows the panes as you left them. The keyboard goes to the
pane that had the focus, in terminal mode.

- Each session has one scratch terminal. tuios creates it the first time you
  press the key.
- The first shell starts in the folder of the focused pane, or in your home
  folder.
- The box shows over the workspace you are on. Its frame shows the name.
- When you hide it, the focus goes back to the pane you used before, in the
  mode you used before.
- The window keys act inside the box while a pane of the scratch terminal has
  the focus: split, focus movement, resize, swap, zoom, close and multifocus.
  `tuios xpanes` that you run in a pane of the scratch terminal opens its panes
  in the scratch terminal.
- A pane of the scratch terminal is not minimized, not floated and not moved
  to a workspace. The dock shows a message for a move.
- Closing a pane closes it. When you close the last pane, the scratch terminal
  ends and the box goes away. The next `Ctrl+B` `g` starts a new one.
- A focus on a pane of the hidden scratch terminal, for example with
  `tuios focus-window`, shows the box first.
- A click outside the box hides it and focuses the pane under the pointer. The
  click does nothing else. A focus on a pane outside the box, by a key or from
  the sidebar, also hides it.
- The mouse acts on the panes inside the box, as on a workspace. The box
  itself does not move or change size. Its size comes from `[scratch]`.
- The key works from inside the box. tuios reads `Ctrl+B` before the shell
  gets it.
- The sidebar, the window list, the window count and the workspace list do not
  show the panes of the scratch terminal. The `tuios list-windows` table does
  not show them. `tuios list-windows --json` shows each with `"scratch": true`,
  its `"scratch_name"`, and a workspace number of 1000 or more.
- The focus is part of the session. When a client shows the scratch terminal,
  every client of the session shows it.
- When you detach, the scratch terminal stays as it is. It is there when you
  attach again.
- After a daemon restart, the scratch terminal comes back hidden. Each pane has
  a new shell in its own folder, under its saved history, in the same layout.
- In a session on a different machine, the key does not open a scratch
  terminal. The dock shows a message.
- Until the daemon restarts after an upgrade, and while a client of an older
  tuios is attached to the session, the scratch terminal is one pane in a
  popup, as in older versions. The key shows and hides it the same way.

```toml
[scratch]
width = "80%"  # cells (100) or percent (80%)
height = "80%"
```

The `session` key is no longer used. tuios ignores it, and the config
warnings tell you to remove it.

The scratch terminal is part of the current session. It does not make a
separate session, so it does not change the session that a bare
`tuios attach` picks.

The first version of this key made a session called `scratch`. tuios does not
use that session any more. To remove it, run `tuios kill-session scratch`.

To add more scratch terminals, each on its own key and with its own command,
add `[[keybindings.command]]` entries of type `scratch`. See
[KEYBINDINGS.md](KEYBINDINGS.md#command-keys). Each one has its own layout,
and the rules above apply to each of them. One box is on the screen at a
time: a show replaces the other. After a daemon restart, the first pane of an
entry has a shell, not the command of the entry. To start the command again,
close the pane.

The action is `toggle_scratch`. To use a different key, bind the action in
`[keybindings.prefix_mode]` or in a different section. If your config puts `g`
on a different prefix action, `toggle_scratch` has no key.
`tuios keybinds doctor` shows this.

## Picture in Picture

The picture-in-picture view is a small live copy of one pane in a corner of
the screen. Use it to watch a pane, such as a coding agent, while you work in a
different pane.

To pin the focused pane, press `p` in window mode. Press `p` again, on any
pane, to unpin it. The command palette has the same command. From a shell, run
`tuios pip <window>` to pin a pane by ID or name, and `tuios pip --off` to
unpin it.

- The view is not the pane. The pane stays where it is in the layout. It keeps
  running when it is on a different workspace, minimized or in a hidden
  scratch terminal.
- The view shows the last rows of the pane that hold text, from the left edge,
  at one cell for each cell. Its border shows the pane name and the agent
  state mark. It shows text only. Images do not show in it.
- The view is on top of the tiled panes and a zoomed pane. Popups, the scratch
  terminal, menus and panels are on top of the view.
- The view never takes the focus or a key.
- A click on the view focuses the pane. tuios goes to the workspace of the
  pane, restores a minimized pane and shows a hidden scratch terminal.
- The view does not show while its pane has the focus.
- The view does not cover the cursor of the focused pane or the text to the
  left of the cursor. When that text reaches the view, the view moves to a
  different corner.
- When the pane closes, the view closes and the dock shows a message.
- Each client has its own view. The view is not in the session state, so a
  different client does not see it. A detach or a switch to a different
  session removes it.
- `tuios pip` reaches one client. With more than one client attached, it acts
  on the client that `tuios run-command` reaches. When you attach to a session
  on a different machine, that machine cannot pin a pane on your screen.
- A kitty image in a pane under the view is cut around the view. A sixel image
  is not, so it can draw over the view. Floating panes have the same limit.
- One pane at a time is pinned. A pin replaces the previous one.
- The view reads the cells that the pane already holds. It adds no timer and
  does no work while the pane is quiet.

```toml
[pip]
width = 40               # cells, border included
height = 12
corner = "bottom-right"  # bottom-right, bottom-left, top-right or top-left
```

The action is `toggle_pip`. If your config puts `p` on a different window
mode action, `toggle_pip` has no key. `tuios keybinds doctor` shows this.

## What Survives

Four tiers of interruption, and what comes back after each. "Structure" means
window count, geometry, workspace assignment, custom names, minimize state, the
BSP tree and the layout mode.

| | Client exits (detach, crash, SSH drop) | Daemon restart (`kill-server`, `SIGTERM`) | Daemon crash (`SIGKILL`, OOM) | Reboot |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Session exists afterwards | Yes | Yes, restored on daemon start | Yes, restored on daemon start | Yes, restored on daemon start |
| Session id | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Window structure | Yes | Yes | Partial: as of the last save, a couple of seconds stale | Partial: as of the last save |
| Shell processes | Yes, they keep running | No, fresh shells are spawned | No, fresh shells are spawned | No, fresh shells are spawned |
| Working directories | Yes | Yes, on Linux and macOS (see below) | Partial: the cwd from the last save | Partial: the cwd from the last save |
| Screen contents | Yes | Yes, as history above a divider (see below) | Partial: as of the pane's last save, up to 30 seconds stale | Yes, as for a daemon restart |
| Scrollback | Yes | Yes, the last 1000 lines by default | Partial: as of the pane's last save | Yes, as for a daemon restart |
| Running programs (vim, tail, a build) | Yes | No | No | No |
| Agent conversations (resumable harnesses) | Yes, the agent keeps running | The conversation, not the process: see below | Same | Same |
| Sidebar shown or hidden | Yes | Yes | Partial: as of the last save | Partial: as of the last save |
| Copy-mode position, selection | No, per-client | No | No | No |
| Input mode (window vs terminal) | No, per-client | No | No | No |

The client column is the important one: a detach costs you nothing, because the
daemon holds the PTYs and keeps a terminal emulator fed for each. On reattach the
client asks the daemon for each window's screen and scrollback and repaints it.
Copy-mode state and input mode are deliberately per-client and are not restored,
so that one client entering terminal mode does not change what another client is
doing.

The three daemon columns are all resurrection, described next. Nothing survives
a daemon exit except what was written to disk.

The session id is saved in the state file, so a restored session keeps its id
and a client that stored the id still finds the session. A state file from a
build before ids were saved has none, and that session gets a new id once.

## Resurrection

Resurrection is how a session comes back after the daemon that held it is gone.

Each live session writes its state to a JSON file within a couple of seconds of
any change to its structure, again every 30 seconds whether or not anything
changed (which is how each window's working directory stays current, since
typing `cd` changes no structure), and once more on a clean shutdown
(`kill-server`, `SIGTERM` or `SIGINT`). A session nothing has changed costs one
write per 30 seconds, as it always did. The final save happens
while the shells are still alive, which is what makes the working directories in
it accurate. The write is atomic: a temp file is renamed into place, so a crash
mid-write cannot leave a half-written file where a good one used to be.

The state file holds the session's structure: its windows with their geometry,
titles, custom names, workspace, minimize state, its focus, its BSP trees, its
layout mode, and each window's working directory. It does not hold anything
about the processes that were running. Each pane's history is saved in a
separate file. See [Pane history](#pane-history).

When the daemon starts, it restores every session it finds saved state for. For
each window it spawns a **fresh shell** in that window's saved working directory
(falling back to the shell's default directory if the saved path no longer
exists), and writes a dim one-line notice into it:

```
-- tuios: session restored, fresh shell in /home/you/project --
```

When the pane has saved history, the notice is a divider under that history:

```
$ make
...the last lines of the build...
$
-- tuios: restored from Sep 30 14:02, fresh shell in /home/you/project --
$ _
```

Restored shells get `TUIOS_RESTORED=1` in their environment, so your shell rc can
react to a restore without relying on the banner.

The session itself is marked too, so you can tell a session that just came back
from one that has been running for days without opening a pane. A restored
session shows a `restored` tag in `tuios ls`, in the sidebar and in the session
switcher, and `tuios attach` says so before it hands over the screen:

```
Session "work" was restored: layout came back from saved state; the shells are new.
```

The mark is cleared by the first attach, on the reasoning that once you have
looked at the session the question has been answered. It never comes back for
that session unless the daemon restores it again.

What this means in practice: your layout comes back and each pane is sitting in
the right directory, but whatever was running in those panes is not. A `vim` you
had open is closed and a build you had running is dead. The output they left
is still there to read, above the divider.

Agents are the exception worth knowing about. An agent's process ends like any
other, and whatever turn it was running does not finish. But a coding agent
keeps its conversation on disk, and a pane whose harness reported the
conversation id (the hooks `tuios integration install` sets up do) keeps that
id in the state file. For such a pane, when its harness has a resume command
(Claude Code, Codex, opencode and more), the restore offers to start the
harness again on the same conversation, as `daemon.resume_agents` says: `ask`
(the default) puts a Resume row in the Inbox that you answer with `y`, `auto`
types `claude --resume <id>` (or the harness's own form) into the new shell,
and `off` does neither. `tuios resume-agent -w <pane>` does it by hand. See
[Agent state](AGENT_STATE.md#resuming-after-a-restart).

Start the daemon with `--no-restore` to skip automatic restoration; saved state
is left on disk and can still be restored on demand with `tuios resurrect`.

A session killed with `tuios kill-session` has its saved state deleted, because
an explicit kill is a deliberate teardown and must not leave the session
restorable. Quitting a daemon session from inside the client (`Ctrl+B` `q`) kills
the session and so does the same.

If a state file is corrupt, or was written by a newer TUIOS whose format this
build does not understand, it is moved into an archive directory rather than
deleted, and skipped. One bad file can never block the daemon from starting or
prevent other sessions from being restored.

### Pane history

The daemon saves each pane's history next to the session's state file, and a
restore shows it again. The history comes back as text to read. It is not
replayed into the new shell, and no command in it runs again.

What comes back:

- The pane's scrollback, up to 1000 lines by default, and the screen it
  showed. Colors, bold and other styles, wide characters and wrapped lines
  come back as they were.
- The shell's screen when a full-screen program such as `vim` or `htop` was
  open. The program's own screen does not come back.
- The scratch terminal's history. Other popups do not come back, so their
  history is not saved.

A pane that ran on another machine through `[hosts]` comes back as a shell on
this machine, without history. That machine keeps its own copy.

Copy mode, search and hints reach the restored lines like any other history.
An agent pane keeps its resume offer. The resumed agent starts under the
divider.

When the history is saved:

- On a clean stop (`kill-server`, `SIGTERM`, a reboot that stops the daemon),
  for every pane with new output.
- During the session, with the periodic save, for a pane with new output. One
  pane is saved at most once in 30 seconds, so a pane that prints without end
  costs one write in 30 seconds. An idle pane is not written again.

After a crash (`SIGKILL`, an out-of-memory kill), a pane comes back with its
history as of its last save, which can be up to 30 seconds old.

Where it goes and how big it gets:

- One file for each pane in
  `$XDG_STATE_HOME/tuios/sessions/scrollback/<session>/`. The directory is
  mode 0700 and each file is mode 0600.
- Each file is compressed. It is at most 2 MiB by default. A pane with more
  saves fewer lines.
- All the files of one session are at most 16 MiB together. A pane that does
  not fit saves fewer lines.
- The daemon deletes a pane's file when the pane closes, and a session's
  files when the session is killed. A renamed session keeps its files.
- When the daemon starts, it deletes history that has no saved session.

> **Privacy.** The history files hold what your panes printed, which can
> include passwords, tokens and other secrets. They stay on your disk until
> the pane or the session goes. To stop this, set `persist_scrollback = false`
> in `[daemon]`. The next time the daemon starts, it deletes the history it
> saved before.

```toml
[daemon]
persist_scrollback = true         # save each pane's history (default true)
persist_scrollback_lines = 1000   # most history lines one pane saves (0 = 1000)
persist_scrollback_kb = 2048      # most KiB one pane's file takes (0 = 2048)
```

The daemon reads these settings when it starts.

## The resurrect Command

```bash
tuios resurrect              # list the sessions that can be restored
tuios resurrect mysession    # restore that session and attach to it
```

With no arguments, `tuios resurrect` prints a table of every saved session with
its window count, whether it is already live, and how long ago its state was
saved.

With a name, it starts the daemon if necessary, asks it to restore that session
from saved state, and attaches. It is a no-op if the daemon already restored the
session on start, in which case you simply attach to the live one. `restore` is
an alias for the same command.

If the restore fails, the command says which of the reasons applies: there is no
saved state under that name, the state is corrupt, or the state was written by a
newer TUIOS. In the last two cases it also prints where the file was archived.

## Windows on Another Machine

A window's process does not have to run on the machine the session is on.

```bash
tuios new-window deploy --host build
```

The window belongs to the session it was created in. It is drawn here, sized by
the layout here, and closed here; only the process is on `build`. The machine
comes from the `[hosts]` table, the same one `tuios hosts` lists, and a name
that is not in it is refused before anything is started.

A session holding such a window is still an ordinary session, so `tuios ls`, the
verbs, the mailbox, hooks and resurrection keep working on it with no special
case. What makes the window different is one field recording where its process
is.

Panes on two machines can sit side by side in one layout, because each pane is
a window of this session and the layout does not care where any of their
processes are.

### What it looks like

A pane whose shell is elsewhere says so on its title bar, as `build:name`. This
is not optional: two panes side by side are otherwise identical, and the same
typed line is a different act depending on which machine answers it.

### Agents in a pane on another machine

Agent detection works. The daemon that owns the window cannot do it alone: the
pane's process is on the other machine, so the pid it would read means nothing
here and every tier of detection starts from that process. It asks the other
machine what the pane is running, through the `pane-agent` verb, and decides
what the answer means itself. The rules, the manifests and your configuration
stay with the window.

An agent in such a pane also reports its own state and reads its mail, with the
same commands and hooks as anywhere. The pane has `TUIOS_PANE_ID`, the window's
id on the machine holding it, and `TUIOS_PANE_HOSTED=1`, and no `TUIOS_SOCKET`.
A report the agent sends naming `$TUIOS_PANE_ID` goes to the daemon on the
machine it runs on, which sends it back over a channel the daemon holding the
window opened, since the link is dialled one way. The daemon holding the window
runs it as that window and nothing else. Only the process in the pane is
forwarded for, and only state, meta, session id, its own mail and a wait for its
own mail cross. See [A pane on another machine](AGENT_STATE.md#a-pane-on-another-machine).
With a machine holding the window from before this, the pane has no
`TUIOS_PANE_ID` and a report fails with `protocol_mismatch`; the agent is still
detected.

`TUIOS_SESSION` is deliberately not set in such a pane. It would name a session
on the other machine, and every tool that reads it addresses a session on the
machine it is running on. `TUIOS_SESSION_REMOTE` carries the name for anything
that wants to know where the pane came from.

Sending mail between machines is a different thing and it does work: see
`tuios send-agent-message -s build:api -w 1 'text'`. When `build`'s link is
down the message waits on this machine and goes when the link is back; see
[Mail waiting for another machine](AGENT_STATE.md#mail-waiting-for-another-machine). A reply from the person
over a link is verified on the far machine only when this machine vouched for
the process that sent it: one outside every pane here. The far daemon hears
that from the link itself, not from the request, and an agent in a pane here
that attaches or sends through the link cannot be verified there. See [Who
can act as the person](AGENT_STATE.md#who-can-act-as-the-person).

### What crosses, and what does not

The machine supplying the process supplies a process and a pty, and nothing
else. It runs no terminal emulator for the pane and keeps no scrollback for it,
and it does not know which session the pane belongs to. All of that is here, on
the daemon that owns the window, exactly as it is for a pane of its own.

That division has a consequence worth knowing: the pane is **not** a window of
any session on the other machine. It will not appear in `tuios ls` there, and
it is not enrolled in that machine's size negotiation, so a layout here can
never shrink a session someone is working in there.

### Pasting an image

`Ctrl+B V` pastes the image on your clipboard into the focused pane. tuios
reads the image on your machine and sends it over the link. The other machine
writes it to a file and tuios pastes the path of that file into the pane. An
agent in the pane, such as Claude Code, can then read the image. The file is
8 MB or less, only you can read it, and it is deleted after one hour. The
other machine needs a tuios with `paste-pane-image`. See [Paste an
image](KEYBINDINGS.md#paste-an-image).

### What it needs

Both machines need a tuios new enough to speak `open-pane`. An older one
refuses by name and says to update it.

### What the other machine may do here

The machine a link arrives at decides what the machine at the other end may
do there, from its own `[hosts]` table: read listings, send mail, open
sessions, windows and panes, write into panes, and answer prompts. By default
it may do everything but answer prompts for you. Opening a window on a host
needs `open` there; what is typed into that window travels on the pane's own
connection and needs nothing more. See [What another machine
may do here](CONFIGURATION.md#what-another-machine-may-do-here) for the table,
`hold_mail`, and pinning the name with a forced command.

### Limits

- **The window outlives a dropped link for a while.** When the link drops, the
  other machine keeps the process running for its `hosted_grace` (ten minutes
  unless its `[hosts]` table says otherwise, see [What another machine may do
  here](CONFIGURATION.md#what-another-machine-may-do-here)) and keeps its last
  64 KB of output. The window stays, its title bar reads
  `[reconnecting] build:name`, the rail row reads `build reconnecting`, and
  keystrokes are refused rather than queued. When the link comes back the pane
  is reattached, what the process printed meanwhile is written to it, and it is
  live again. If more was printed than 64 KB, the whole 64 KB is written and the
  pane is resized a row and back, so a full screen program draws its screen
  again. If the grace runs out first, or the process exits meanwhile, the
  window closes the way it closes when its shell exits. With `hosted_grace =
  "0"` on the other machine, or a tuios there too old to keep a pane, the
  window ends when the link does, as it always did.
- **Closing the window ends the process at once.** A window closed on purpose
  tells the other machine with `close-pane`, so its process does not wait out
  the grace. If the link is down when it is closed, the grace ends it.
- **A restart of this daemon does not reattach.** The panes on the other
  machine wait out their grace and end.
- **A resurrected session brings the window back on this machine.** Resurrection
  respawns a shell from saved state, and it does not redial a host to do it.
- **A resurrected window runs a local shell.** The layout comes back and the
  pane in it is on this machine, whatever it said before.

## Agents and Worktrees on Another Machine

A hosted window keeps the window here and the process there, and ends when the
link stays down past the far machine's `hosted_grace`. For agent work that
should outlive the link for good, start the whole session on the other machine
instead. `tuios fan --host build`, `tuios worktree new --host
build` and `tuios start-agent -s build:SESSION` make the sessions on build,
where they run and survive like any of build's sessions, and they show in the
rail under build.

The repository is named by the origin URL of the checkout you run the command
in. build finds its own checkout of it under `repos_root` in `[hosts.build]`:

```toml
[hosts.build]
addr = "gaurav@buildbox"
repos_root = "~/src"   # a path on build, as build reads it
```

With no `repos_root`, build looks under `~/src`, `~/dev`, `~/code`,
`~/projects`, `~/repos`, `~/git`, `~/work` and `~/go/src` there. `--clone`
clones the repository there when build has none.

`tuios worktree pull build:SESSION` brings a worktree session's commits and its
uncommitted work into a new worktree session here, on a new branch. Nothing on
build changes. See [CLI Reference](CLI_REFERENCE.md#tuios-worktree).

## Global Sessions

A session whose panes are all on one machine is that machine's session. A
session holding panes from several is not, and the rail says so: once a second
machine is reachable, it draws a group called `global` above the machines.

```
global                +
  deploy
local                 +
  work
build                 +
  api
```

Sessions in the global group work like any other. What is different is that
every way of making a window in one asks which machine it should run on, by
every route: the key, the rail's `+`, the command palette. That question has one
sensible answer in an ordinary session and is worth asking in this one, which is
why the picker appears here and nowhere else.

Make one from the `+` on the group header, or from the shell:

```bash
tuios new deploy --global
```

A global session is created with no windows, since the first pane is the one you
pick a machine for.

The group holds as many sessions as you make. It is drawn above the machines
because a global session is not any machine's: it is held by a daemon, the way
any session is, but where it is held says nothing about where its panes run.

Turn the group off with `global_session = false` in the config. Sessions that
already exist stay listed.

## Keeping Hosts on One Version

`tuios hosts sync` installs the tuios version of this machine on every host in
the `[hosts]` table that runs another one. A release build sends its own
release, `--dev` sends a build of the checkout, and `--binary` sends a file.

```sh
tuios hosts sync --dry-run    # see what would change
tuios hosts sync --dev        # install a build of this checkout everywhere
```

The daemon on a host keeps running the old version, and its sessions keep
running. The row for the host gives the command to restart it. Add
`--restart` to restart them in the same run: sync lists the sessions and the
programs that a restart ends, and asks first. The sessions come back after the
restart with their layouts and new shells. See
[`tuios hosts sync`](CLI_REFERENCE.md#tuios-hosts-sync).

## Starting the Daemon on a Host

A link reaches a host only when a tuios daemon runs there. When none runs,
`tuios hosts test NAME` reports `no_daemon` and prints the command to run on
the host. To start the daemon from this machine, add `--start`:

```sh
tuios hosts test build --start    # start the daemon on build if it does not run
tuios hosts sync build --start    # install tuios on build if needed, then start it
```

`hosts test --start` does not install tuios. On a host with no tuios, use
`hosts sync --start`. See [`tuios hosts test`](CLI_REFERENCE.md#tuios-hosts-test).

## Adding a Phone

A phone connects to this machine over ssh and runs
`tuios stdio-proxy --as NAME`. To give the phone its key with no copy and
paste, use `tuios pair`:

```sh
tuios pair --name phone
```

1. Scan the QR code with the tuios app on the phone.
2. Compare the check code and the key fingerprint on the screen with the ones
   on the phone.
3. Type `y` to accept the key.

The phone must reach this machine, for example on the same Wi-Fi network or
on your tailnet. The code works one time, for 5 minutes. Anyone who sees the
code can try to pair until the phone does. Do not show the code on a shared
screen.

The key can only open a tuios link under the name `phone`. tuios writes a new
`[hosts.phone]` table first, and then adds the key. The table sets what the
phone may do. By default it allows `list` and `mail`:

- `list` lets the phone read: listings, pane captures, screenshots, agent
  state, the Inbox and the event stream.
- `mail` lets the phone send and read agent mail.

The phone cannot start programs, type into panes or answer prompts. To allow
more, give `--allow`, for example `--allow list,mail,open,write`. See
[`tuios pair`](CLI_REFERENCE.md#tuios-pair) for each flag and the protocol.

To remove the phone, delete the line that ends in `tuios-pair:phone` from
`~/.ssh/authorized_keys`, and the `[hosts.phone]` table from `config.toml`.

## Machines on a Tailnet

If this machine is on a [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com) tailnet, tuios can
list the machines on it and offer them as addresses:

```bash
tuios hosts tailnet
```

```
   arch-btw          arch-btw.example.ts.net          offline
 + ente              ente.example.ts.net
 = forgejo           forgejo.example.ts.net           already the host forgejo
   my-phone          my-phone.example.ts.net          cannot run tuios (iOS)
```

Add one:

```bash
tuios hosts add ente --tailnet
```

**Nothing is added on its own.** This is the same rule the ssh_config aliases
follow: a host exists because you named it. What is discovered is what to type,
not what to connect to.

**Nothing new is dialled either.** A host added this way is reached over ssh like
every other host. A MagicDNS name resolves like any other name, so the tailnet is
how the name resolves and how the traffic is carried, and tuios does not open a
tailnet connection itself. That also means ssh over a tailnet already worked
before this existed: you could always write the MagicDNS name as an address by
hand. This saves you the typing and tells you what is there.

tuios asks the `tailscaled` already running on this machine, through the local
API, which is the same thing `tailscale status` asks. It needs no root, no
auth key, and no operator setting. A machine with no tailscale on it gets an
empty list and behaves exactly as it did before.

Every machine is listed, offered or not, and one that is not offered says why.
By default a machine is left out when it is offline, when it is this machine,
when it was shared in from another tailnet, or when it runs an operating system
that cannot host a tuios daemon.

Change any of that in the `[tailscale]` table:

```toml
[tailscale]
# Offer tailnet machines as addresses at all.
enabled = true
# Which form of address: "dns" is the MagicDNS name and works anywhere on the
# tailnet, "name" is the short name and needs a search domain, "ip" is the
# 100.x address and needs no DNS.
addr = "dns"
# An ssh login put in front of every address.
user = "ubuntu"
# The operating systems to offer. An empty list offers every machine.
os = ["linux", "macOS", "windows"]
# Offer machines that are offline, this machine, and machines shared in.
offline = false
self = false
shared = false
# Glob patterns matched against the short name and the MagicDNS name.
# exclude wins over include.
include = ["*"]
exclude = ["*-pad-*"]
# How many to offer.
max = 50
# Where the tailscaled local API socket is, if it is not in the usual place.
socket = ""

# Per-machine logins, which win over the user above. This has to come last,
# because everything after a sub-table heading belongs to it.
[tailscale.users]
build = "root"
```

For a script or an agent, `tuios hosts tailnet --json` gives every machine with
`offered` and, when it is false, `skipped` saying which rule left it out.

### Tailscale SSH check mode

Tailscale SSH can hold a login until you approve it in a browser. This is
"check" mode. ssh then waits, and Tailscale prints a link to open:

```
# Tailscale SSH requires an additional check.
# To authenticate, visit: https://login.tailscale.com/a/l1d9c7e392d3020
```

tuios reads this link and shows it.

- **The rail** shows "sign in" beside the host, in the colour of an agent that
  needs you. Click "sign in", or move the cursor to it and press Enter, to open
  the sign-in page in your browser. The notice names the domain of the page and
  the host. A click on the name of the host still folds its group. Hover the
  host to see why it waits. On an ssh or web client, tuios cannot start your
  browser. It shows the address in a notice and puts it on your clipboard.
- **Only a Tailscale address opens.** The link comes from ssh's error output,
  and anything on the host can print there. tuios shows and opens it only when
  it is https on `login.tailscale.com` or `controlplane.tailscale.com`, matched
  exactly. For any other address, the rail says "The sign-in link from NAME is
  not a Tailscale address, so tuios did not open it." Run ssh to the host in a
  terminal to see it. With Headscale, give the origin of your server for that
  host: `tailscale_login = "https://headscale.example"` in `[hosts.NAME]`.
- **The daemon's link** waits up to 10 minutes on one page. It goes on when you
  sign in, and the host comes up on the rail with no other step. When Tailscale
  ends the wait, the link asks again and shows a new page. After you open a
  page from the rail or with `tuios hosts signin`, the link asks again every few
  seconds for two minutes.
- **`tuios hosts`** shows the status "sign in", with the page to open and the
  command that opens it. In `--json` the status stays `tailscale_check`, with
  `approval_url`.
- **`tuios hosts signin [NAME]`** opens the sign-in page of each host that
  waits, or of the named host. With no desktop, as over ssh, it prints the
  address. `--print` prints it and opens nothing. `--json` prints
  `{"hosts":[{"host","url","opened","note"}]}`.
- **`tuios hosts test`** and **`tuios hosts add`** report `tailscale_check`
  with the link. Open it, approve the login, then run the command again.
- **`tuios hosts sync`** on a terminal lists the link of each host that waits.
  Then it asks to wait up to 5 minutes. Each host continues when you approve
  its login. Without a terminal, or with `--json`, the host fails at once.
  Its row has `"error_kind": "tailscale_check"` and `approval_url`.

All ssh calls of one `hosts sync` run to a host use one shared connection.
Thus one approval covers the whole run. The connection uses a private socket
in `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` and stops when the run ends.

If the tailnet policy refuses the login, tuios names the user it refused. The
row has `"error_kind": "tailscale_policy"`. Change the user in the `addr` of the
host in `[hosts]`, for example `addr = "ubuntu@ente"`.

## Copying

Copying is the one gesture in a terminal with no result to look at: the text
does not change, and the selection usually disappears. So a copy sweeps a band
of light across the cells that were taken, once, and then it is gone.
Set `appearance.motion` to `none` to turn the sweep off.

```toml
[appearance.selection]
flash = true
flash_ms = 420
flash_color = "#FFF3C4"
# diagonal, diagonal-reverse, horizontal, vertical
flash_style = "diagonal"
```

The shape is a choice because which one reads best depends on what you copy.
A diagonal falls across a paragraph. A horizontal one crosses a single long
line properly, where a diagonal barely leans at all over one row. A vertical
one moves down a tall narrow block, which the other three cross in an instant.

The same table holds the colours a pane marks text with: the selection, search
matches, the match under the cursor, and the copy mode cursor. They follow the
theme nowhere else in tuios, because they are the one part of a pane's colours
tuios chooses rather than the program running in it, so they are settings. A
text colour left empty keeps the colour the program wrote, and tints only the
background behind it.

`multi_format` is the format that multi copy mode starts with: `plain`,
`markdown` or `json`. Multi copy mode copies the selection of each pane in the
multifocus set. See [Multi copy mode](LAYOUT_MODES.md#multi-copy-mode).

```toml
[appearance.selection]
multi_format = "plain"
```

`copy_entry` sets where the copy cursor starts when copy mode starts. `cursor`
is the terminal cursor, usually the prompt line, as in tmux. `center` is the
first column of the middle row. In multi copy mode, each pane starts at its own
cursor. See [Copy mode](KEYBINDINGS.md#copy-mode) for the search keys.

```toml
[appearance.selection]
copy_entry = "cursor"
```

`copy_command` is a command that gets each yank in copy mode on stdin. The
clipboard gets what the command writes to stdout. When the value is empty,
the default, `y` copies the selection as it is. See
[Pipe a yank through a command](KEYBINDINGS.md#pipe-a-yank-through-a-command).

```toml
[appearance.selection]
copy_command = "tr -s ' '"
```

`osc52_write` controls what happens when a program in a pane sets the
clipboard with OSC 52. An editor uses OSC 52 to yank over ssh. Any output can
also carry OSC 52, for example a file that a program prints.

| Value | What happens |
|---|---|
| `off` | The host clipboard does not change. |
| `ask` | The dock shows a message. Click the message to copy the text. |
| `focused` | The focused pane copies. Other panes ask. This is the default. |
| `on` | Every pane copies. |

When the focused pane copies text with a line break or a control character,
the dock shows one line for that pane. A one-line copy shows nothing. A click
on an ask copies only the text that the dock showed. If the text changes
first, click the new message.

A pane that runs without the daemon keeps its own copy of the text. The
program reads it back with an OSC 52 query. A pane under the daemon keeps no
copy. An OSC 52 query in that pane always gets an empty answer.

```toml
[appearance.selection]
osc52_write = "focused"
```

A paste into a pane drops ESC and the other control characters from the text.
Tabs and line breaks stay. Text that holds `ESC[201~` cannot end a bracketed
paste early.

The scrollback browser draws from the same two places: the theme for its
chrome, and these settings for its search and selection, so a match there and
a match in a pane are the same colour.

## Where State Lives

| What | Path |
|---|---|
| Saved session state | `$XDG_STATE_HOME/tuios/sessions/<name>.json` (typically `~/.local/state/tuios/sessions/`) |
| Archived bad state | `$XDG_STATE_HOME/tuios/sessions/archive/`, pruned after 14 days |
| Daemon socket | `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/tuios/tuios.sock`, falling back to `/tmp/tuios-<uid>/tuios.sock` |
| Daemon PID file | the socket path with `.pid` appended |

The socket lives in the runtime directory and does not survive a reboot, which is
correct: the daemon does not either. Saved session state lives in the state
directory and does survive, which is why a session can be resurrected after a
reboot.

### Running a separate daemon

`XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` chooses the daemon every `tuios` command reaches (on Windows,
`LOCALAPPDATA`). To run a second daemon, for a test or a script, give it its own
runtime and state directories, so it has its own socket and keeps its own saved
sessions:

```bash
export XDG_RUNTIME_DIR=/tmp/scratch/run XDG_STATE_HOME=/tmp/scratch/state
mkdir -p "$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR" && chmod 700 "$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR"
tuios new scratch --detach      # starts a daemon at /tmp/scratch/run/tuios/tuios.sock
tuios ls                        # that daemon's sessions
tuios kill-server               # stops it
```

`TUIOS_SOCKET` does not choose a daemon. tuios sets it in every pane to the
socket of the daemon that runs the pane, so a program can find that daemon, and
every process started from the pane inherits it. A command that finds
`TUIOS_SOCKET` naming a different socket where no daemon is listening refuses
and says what to set, because that is someone expecting it to select a daemon.
When it names the socket the command uses, or another live daemon (a script in
a pane that set its own `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR`), the command runs against the daemon
`XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` names.

## Limitations

- **Screen contents and scrollback survive a daemon restart only as saved
  history.** The daemon keeps them in memory and saves them to disk. A restored
  pane shows the saved history above a divider, with a new shell under it. After
  a crash, the history is as old as the last save. The setting
  `persist_scrollback = false` turns the save off, and then only a detach keeps
  them. A running program and its live screen never survive the daemon.
- **Working directory capture needs Linux or macOS.** The daemon reads where
  each shell is from the process itself: `/proc/<pid>/cwd` on Linux, and
  `proc_pidinfo` (libproc) on macOS, which needs no cgo. On other platforms
  (Windows, the BSDs) the read has no answer and restoration falls back to
  spawning the shell in its default directory. Everything else about the
  restore is unaffected.
- **A crash loses the last couple of seconds of structural change, and up to 30
  seconds of working-directory drift.** Structural changes are saved within a
  couple of seconds; the directory each shell is sitting in is captured on the
  30-second tick, so a `cd` immediately before a `SIGKILL` may not survive.
- **Restored shells use the daemon's environment.** No client is connected at
  restore time, so the shell comes from the daemon process's `$SHELL` and
  inherits the daemon's environment, not that of whichever terminal you later
  attach from.
- **Panes never inherit `TMUX` or `TMUX_PANE`.** Every pane starts from the
  environment of the process that spawns it, less these two, whether it is a
  daemon pane, a pane hosted for another machine, or a standalone pane. A tuios
  started from inside tmux used to pass them on, and a program in the pane then
  believed it was in a tmux pane: Codex wrapped its notifications in tmux
  passthrough, which tuios drops, and an agent that opens panes through tmux
  reached the outer tmux. Running tmux inside a tuios pane still works, and no
  longer warns about nesting.
- **Resurrection restores structure, not work.** It is a way to get your layout
  and directories back, not a way to survive a crash without losing anything.
