With -w the keys go to that window's terminal, whether or not a client is
attached and whichever window has the focus. Without -w they go to the attached
client as if the person pressed them, which drives the window manager or the
focused window. With no client attached they go to the focused window.

To type text, use send-text. send-keys splits its argument on spaces and commas,
so 'echo hello' types "echohello".

Keys (case-insensitive, and the argument is split on spaces and commas):
  Enter Tab BTab Space Comma Escape Backspace
  Up Down Left Right Home End PageUp PageDown Insert Delete F1-F12
  a single character: q, j, /, G
  ctrl+X, alt+X, shift+X on a character or a key: ctrl+c, alt+b, shift+Up
  PREFIX: the leader key (only without -w, with a client attached)

Other spellings of the same keys work too: up, UP, arrow-up, ArrowUp, KEY_UP,
<Up>, PgDn, Page_Down, Esc, Return, BSpace, tmux's C-c and M-x, and ^C. An
escape sequence can be written as \e[A, \x1b[A or \033[A. A word that looks
like a misspelled key (Dwon, KEY_FOO, F13) is refused with the list of names,
and nothing is sent.

The list is closed and stable. The list-keys verb returns it, with every
spelling of every key.

--repeat sends the whole sequence that many times. The command prints where the
keys went: "sent 5 keys to window docs (d6b97fe4)".

Window targeting (-w), tried in this order: the full id, the index
list-windows prints, the exact window name, then a unique id prefix. A name set
with --name or new-window wins over a program's title. An ambiguous target is an error that lists the windows
it matched.`,

The window is created by the daemon whether or not a client is attached, so this

on to the id.

Arguments after the name are an argv the window runs as its own process instead
of a shell. Nothing re-parses them, so nothing needs quoting. The window closes
when the program exits. Put -- before a command that has flags of its own, or
tuios reads them as its own flags: tuios new-window log -- git log --oneline.

--workspace picks the workspace, --cwd sets the starting directory, and
--no-focus leaves the focus where it is.

The output is the short id and the name, "d6b97fe4  build". Either one is a
window target for -w. --print-id prints the full id alone, for a script:
id=$(tuios new-window build --print-id).

--host runs the window's process on another machine from the [hosts] table. The
window still belongs to this session and is drawn and sized here. Only the
process is over there. There is no special mode to turn on: a session holding
one is an ordinary session with a window that happens to be elsewhere, so it
lists, scripts and restores like any other.

--grants says what the window's process may do through tuios: read, write,
fan, respond, admin, or none. Without it the window holds the default of

Needs an attached client, because a popup is a thing on a screen. It is not
tiled, it is not in the window cycle, and it cannot be minimized.

The popup writes to its own screen, not to this command's output. With --wait
this command stays open until the popup's command exits, and exits with its
status. --capture-stdout (which implies --wait) also sends the command's
standard output here instead of into the popup: a picker such as fzf or gum
draws on the terminal and prints only the choice, so the choice is what this
command prints. Not on Windows.

It does not touch the recipient's keyboard, which is the point: a message can be
left for an agent that is mid-turn, and it is there when that agent next reads
its inbox. Nothing delivers it for you, so the recipient has to be one that
checks. For an agent that does not, ask-agent types the question instead.

--reply-to answers a message by its id. The reply joins that message's thread,
and a reply to a reply joins the same one. A reply is the only acknowledgement
between agents that means anything, so answer the message rather than sending a
fresh one. Read a thread back with 'read-agent-messages --thread'.

The ring is bounded and it is not durable: messages die with the daemon, a full
ring drops its oldest, and a message to a window that has since closed reads
back undeliverable rather than being handed to whatever pane takes its name.

A reply to a message the ring has already dropped is still stored. It starts its
thread from the id you named, and the answer says the parent is gone.

This is the difference between typing at a pane and asking an agent a question.

so that is what is waited on. A pane that reports no state falls back to going
quiet for --settle. The answer says which of the two ended the wait.

an agent is waiting on a prompt, most often a permission menu, and the question
would be read as the answer. That fails with agent_blocked and nothing is typed.
read the prompt with capture-pane and answer it yourself or ask the person.
--allow-blocked overrides it, for a prompt you have read that takes free text.
It will not type at an agent that is working, which is what --force overrides
at the cost of interleaving with whatever the target is doing. --force does not
override agent_blocked. And it will not open an ask that closes a loop with one
already in flight, so B cannot ask A back while A is still blocked on B.

After Enter, the target has --stall-timeout (5 seconds) to show it took the
question: turn working or needs_input, finish a turn, or, for an agent that
cannot show working, print something. If it shows none of these the ask fails
with prompt_stalled. The question was typed, so look at the pane with
capture-pane before sending it again: it may be sitting in the input box.

it as data, not as instructions.

--select asks every agent pane a selector matches, at most 16, all at once.

A tuios daemon on another machine runs this over ssh to read this machine's
