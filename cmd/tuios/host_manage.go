// that writes a host, and adding one would put the config file behind a
// control protocol for no gain.
//
// Only the [hosts.NAME] table is touched. The rest of the file, comments
// included, is left exactly as the user wrote it. See internal/config's
// hosts_edit.go.

The name is what you type to name the machine. It accepts letters, digits, dot,
dash and underscore. The address is anything ssh understands, including an
ssh_config alias.

The change takes effect at once. A running daemon reads the config file and
opens the link. You do not have to restart it.

The link is tested at once, for a few seconds, and the result is printed. A
host that does not answer is still added. Run 'tuios hosts test NAME' when it
is awake.

The link finds tuios on the host by itself. It looks on the PATH, then at the
known install paths, then in a login shell. Add --command to run a given binary
instead. Then nothing is looked for.

To open a session on the host in this client, run
'tuios attach --host NAME SESSION', or press enter on its row in the rail.`,
		Example: `  # A machine you reach as user@host
  tuios hosts add build gaurav@buildbox

This runs ssh itself, so it does not need a daemon and it does not use the
links a daemon already holds. When the link works, it prints which tuios binary
the link runs on the host. When the link fails, it prints what ssh said. That
is where the real reason appears: "Permission denied", "Host key verification
failed". When the link cannot find tuios on the host, it prints every place it
looked.

tuios runs ssh with BatchMode on. A link never asks for a password and never
asks about a host key. Run ssh to the machine once by hand to accept its key.

--start starts the daemon on the host when it does not run. It uses the
tuios binary the link found there, over the same ssh. When tuios is missing on
the host, --start does nothing: run 'tuios hosts sync NAME --start' to install
it and start the daemon.`,
