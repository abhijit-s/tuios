// process ends even when the program cannot carry one out. It returns finish,
// which the caller runs once its cleanup after Program.Run is done.
//
// The guarantee is the point. The quit is asked for with Program.Send, which
// writes to the message channel the event loop reads (tuios passes
// tea.WithoutSignalHandler, so this is the only handler). When the loop is
// stuck writing a frame to a terminal that has stopped draining, that write is
// never read. A force-killed SSH client leaves exactly that behind: a socket
// sshd has not noticed is gone, so it stops draining the pty and the frame
// write blocks. The signal was delivered; the process simply cannot obey it,
// and only SIGHUP, which nothing catches, ends it. So the quit is asked for
// and then, if the run and its cleanup have not finished within
// signalQuitGrace, the process exits outright. A second signal is somebody who
// has already waited once and exits at once.
//
// The handler stays registered until finish, not until Program.Run returns.
// Unregistered during cleanup, a second Ctrl+C would take the default action
// and end the process with the terminal still raw; registered, it follows the
// same policy, and a forced exit restores the terminal first.

// Tea puts it in raw mode, which is what a forced exit restores.
