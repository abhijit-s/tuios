// Conformance for character set designation and the shift states.
//
// This is the oldest machinery in a terminal and the least exercised by modern
// programs, which is exactly why it rots quietly. It is not dead, though:
// terminfo for `screen`, `linux` and `vt100` all spell smacs/rmacs as SO and SI
// rather than as ESC ( 0 / ESC ( B, so anything running under those TERM values
// draws its boxes through the locking shift. A multiplexer hosts whatever the
// guest picked, so both spellings have to work.
//
// Cases follow esctest (tests/esctest/esctest/tests/{si,so,decsc}.py), ghostty's
// src/terminal/charsets.zig, and the VT510 reference manual's tables for SCS,
// LS0-LS3 and SS2/SS3.
