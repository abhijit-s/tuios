// Conformance for the mode matrix: the flags that change what every subsequent
// character does.
//
// A mode is worse than a sequence when it is wrong. A mishandled CUP misplaces
// one character; a mishandled DECAWM or IRM misplaces everything after it, and
// the guest has no way to notice because it is not looking at the screen.
//
// Cases follow esctest, whose mode coverage lives in tests/decset.py and the
// per-sequence files around it,
// the VT510 reference manual's mode tables, and the pending-wrap model xterm
// and ghostty share.
