// Unicode's own recommendation is one U+FFFD per maximal invalid subpart, which
// would give both of these a visible replacement character.
//
// It is left open because terminals disagree with each other here more than any
// of them disagrees with Unicode, and because the property that matters,
// invalid input never becoming a valid character, already holds. Fixing it
// means changing the decoder in x/ansi rather than anything in this package.

// path whenever anything is buffered, which makes every character after the
// first non-ASCII one on a line a buffered write. That is the hottest path in
// the emulator, and the cost is not worth it for the thirteen code points with
// this property, none of which changes what the line looks like: the Prepend
// characters are all invisible formatting marks.
