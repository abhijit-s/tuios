// bindingKeys returns every spelling a binding for msg may be written as, most
// literal first. One physical chord reaches tuios under several names depending
// on what the host terminal negotiated, and a binding has to answer to all of
// them:
//
//   - Key.String() is the text the key produced when there is one, so a binding
//     on "!" matches whether the terminal sent the character or the chord.
//   - Key.Keystroke() is the chord spelling.
//   - baseLayoutKey is the US key at the same position, for a key whose
//     produced character no binding can be spelled in (see usesBaseLayout).
//   - shiftedKey is the chord spelled with the character Shift gave, when the
//     Kitty protocol reports it: on AZERTY Option+Shift+& is alt+1.
//
// After those come the keys that only match under an assumption about the
// keyboard, which the registry keeps in tiers of their own, so that a binding
// written for the key itself always wins:
//
//   - The US-layout tier (config.USLayoutKey): the US spellings of a shifted
//     digit. Asked only when the event does not contradict a US layout.
//   - The Option-glyph tier (config.OptionGlyphKey): the chord a macOS Option
//     character stands for (see composedChords). The registry leaves it empty
//     when keybindings.option_glyphs is "type" or keyboard_layout is "other",
//     and the character is then text that goes to the pane (issue #566).
