// paneKeyBytes encodes a key press for one pane from that pane's own kitty
// keyboard flags, and reports whether the bytes already hold its release.
//
// Each pane reads keys in the mode it asked for, so the focused pane and every
// multifocus peer get their own encoding: a shell peer gets CR for Enter while
// a kitty-protocol pane beside it gets CSI u.
//
// A pane that asked for event types gets a release for every press. The
// release is sent with the press when none will follow it:
//   - for the focused pane, when the host is not reporting releases (a host
//     without the protocol, or the moment after the pane takes the keyboard,
//     before the host has switched to the flags tuios asked for on its behalf)
//   - for a multifocus peer always, since releases go to the focused pane only
//
// Without it a compositor in the pane held the key down, and its client
// repeated it until the next key came.
