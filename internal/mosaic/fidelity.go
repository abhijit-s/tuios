// Fidelity says how much of a picture's shape survives in its cells: the
// correlation between the picture's lightness and the cells' lightness, each
// averaged over blocks of 2x2 cells so that a dither pattern counts as the
// shade it makes. 1 is every light and dark area where it belongs, 0 is no
// relation. A transparent pixel and a cell's own background count as black.
//
// A picture with almost no change in lightness has no shape to keep. It
// scores by how close the cells' mean lightness is to the picture's.
//
// Only the cells of region are measured (in cells, as EncodeRegion takes
// it). cells holds the whole picture, row by row, stride cells a row.
