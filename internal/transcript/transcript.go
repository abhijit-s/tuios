// Package transcript reads an agent's own record of its turn from the file the
// agent writes as it runs, and reports nothing else.
//
// A coding agent that keeps a session log on disk is stating what it did rather
// than painting a picture of it, so the log answers "has this turn finished"
// contractually, where a screen rule can only match how one version of one TUI
// happened to look. That is the whole reason this package exists.
//
// # What it will not do
//
// These files hold the entire conversation: the user's prompts, the contents of
// every file the agent read, and the output of every command it ran. This
// package is built so that leaking any of that is not a matter of care.
//
//   - Records decode into [record], a struct with six scalar fields. Go's
//     encoding/json walks an unknown field to find where it ends and never
//     allocates a Go value for it, so message.content, toolUseResult,
//     lastPrompt, aiTitle and the file-history snapshots are not merely
//     discarded, they are never constructed. There is no map[string]any and no
//     json.RawMessage anywhere in this package, which is what makes that a
//     property of the types rather than of the code that uses them.
//   - Nothing here logs. A line that fails to parse increments a counter and is
//     dropped; the error, which would quote the line, is not kept. The only
//     identifier that ever escapes is the file path the caller already supplied.
//   - The read buffer is a field of [Reader], zeroed after every parse, so a
//     heap dump or a core file taken later does not hold a stale page of
//     someone's conversation. It is a field rather than a parameter because a Go
//     panic traceback prints argument words, and a slice header passed by value
//     would put a pointer to that page in the trace.
//
// The only things that leave this package are a [Turn], which is one of three
// constants, and the offset a read stopped at, which says how far the file
// grew.
