package sessiontree

// A worktree session is a session whose directory is a linked git worktree.
// The daemon records which repository and which branch, and the surfaces group
// those sessions under a row for their repository instead of listing them flat.
// The grouping is the information: five sessions named after five branches of
// one repository say nothing about each other in a flat list, and everything
// about each other under one parent.
//
// This package is deliberately ignorant of internal/session, so the record
// arrives here as the three fields a row is drawn from rather than as the
// daemon's own type.

// WorktreeRef is what a session row needs to know about the worktree it sits
// in. Nil on a session that is not one.
type WorktreeRef struct {
	// Repo is the repository's name, which is what the parent row is titled.
	Repo string
	// Branch is the branch the worktree has checked out, which is what the
	// child row is labelled.
	Branch string
	// Group names the fan-out this session belongs to, empty for a worktree
	// made on its own. Carried for the surfaces that report it; the grouping
	// below is by repository, because that is the row a person looks for.
	Group string
	// Gone says the worktree directory no longer exists. The session is still
	// listed, because a shell whose directory was removed under it still runs.
	Gone bool
	// PR is the short form of the branch's pull request ("PR #12 open
	// pass"), empty when there is none. The agent rows of the session draw
	// it as their pr token.
	PR string
}

// GroupByRepo returns the session list with every worktree session gathered
// under a KindRepo parent row for its repository.
//
// The result is a flat run, not a nested tree: a parent is immediately
// followed by its members, which are the same session nodes with their own
// windows still on them. Every surface that walks the list by session (the
// terminals section, the agents section, the palette) therefore keeps working
// on the members without knowing this ran, and only the surface that draws
// rows has to know what a KindRepo node is.
//
// A parent lands where its first member sat, so a rail the user has dragged
// into an order keeps that order: the group appears where the eye already
// expects the first of its sessions. Members that sit further down are pulled
// up under it. A repository with one worktree session still gets a parent.
//
// Nodes with no record pass through untouched, in place. So do the federated
// rows: a session on another machine is drawn in its host group, and pulling
// one into a local repository group would say it is here.
