// Transcript says where a harness keeps its own record of a session, so the
// daemon can read what the agent said it did rather than infer it from the
// screen. A manifest with no [transcript] block gets exactly today's behaviour,
// which is what almost every harness will have: most keep no such file, and the
// ones that do keep it somewhere of their own choosing.
//
// The manifest says WHERE. A named Go reader says HOW. There is deliberately no
// expression language for deriving state from records: the same argument that
// keeps installer commands out of manifests applies harder here, because this
// code is pointed at a file holding the user's entire conversation, and a
// condition mini-DSL evaluated over that would be both a bug farm and a way to
// select content by writing data. Readers are reviewed, named, and in-tree.
