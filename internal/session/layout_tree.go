// The BSP tree as an op.
//
// A client that reshapes a workspace's tree (a split, a close, a drag of a
// divider, a rotate, a swap) used to say so only inside its next whole-state
// push. The daemon took the tree it found there without being told it had
// changed, a push never advances Version, and every peer then had to guess
// whether the tree in a state was news or an echo of its own. Two clients
// reshaping one tree inside a round trip of each other ended on whichever push
// landed last, and a client could adopt an echo of its own older tree over the
// one it had just built.
//
// Now the client sends the tree for one workspace as MsgLayoutTree, the daemon
// applies it under mutateState, Version advances, and every client (the sender
// included) is sent the result. The client applies its own change to its local
// tree at once, so a drag never waits for the round trip. The push stops
// carrying trees.
//
// The op is the whole tree of one workspace rather than an edit, because every
// tree mutation in the client already ends in a tree, and there are a dozen of
// them. Two ops on one workspace are settled by the order they reach the
// daemon: the later one stands. Nothing is refused. The daemon sends every
// applied op to every client, the sender included, and a client drops any
// state built before its own last op landed (see PushSeen), so every client
// ends on the tree of whichever op landed last. An earlier design refused an
// op built on an older tree than another client's; a drag then lost every
// step after the first conflict, because each step carried the same old base.
//
// Leaves are named by window ID on the wire. The integers in a tree are each
// client's own (GetWindowIntID hands them out locally), so an op carries the
// window ID for every leaf, and the daemon renumbers the leaves into its own
// WindowToBSPID. A client reading a tree from the session translates the
// session's integers back to window IDs and then to its own integers.
