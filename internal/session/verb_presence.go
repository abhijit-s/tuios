// attach-presence: the person's nonce without a screen.
//
// respond, reply-approval, answer-ask and dismiss-attention act as the person,
// and the proof they take is the human_nonce of a client attached now
// (human_sender.go). A phone that only answers the Inbox has no screen to
// attach: a full attach would size the session to the phone and count as a
// client looking at the focused pane, which makes request-approval answer
// viewed instead of holding the prompt for the Inbox.
//
// A presence is the proof and nothing else. The connection that asks for one
// gets a nonce that verifies by every rule an attach nonce does: only from a
// caller that may act as the person (outside every pane here, and over a link
// only on the link-human socket), only over the same kind of connection, and,
// where the kernel names pids, only from the process that holds it. It is
// never attached, so nothing that measures, focuses or speaks to a session's
// clients counts it, and it ends when its connection closes or restricts
// itself. Which sessions it acts in is the nonce scope (human_sender.go): a
// presence made for a session acts only there, and one made with none acts
// in every session.

// verbAttachPresence registers a screenless presence on this connection.
