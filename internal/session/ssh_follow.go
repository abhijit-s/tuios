// Following a pane into ssh.
//
// A person ssh'd into a machine who splits the pane usually wants the new pane
// on that machine too (discussion #468, and tmux-ssh-split before it). The
// daemon can see what the pane runs: the foreground process group of the
// pane's terminal, and the members of that group under it. When one of them is
// an ssh or mosh client, its argument vector says where it connected and how,
// and the new pane runs the same client with the same destination and options.
//
// The daemon runs what it read, so what it reads is held to a narrow shape:
//
//   - The program is never taken from the process. The daemon looks ssh or
//     mosh up on its own PATH. A ./ssh in a project folder, or any binary that
//     calls itself ssh, is not run.
//   - A line is followed only when every -o keyword is in sshAllowConfig, a
//     list of connection options that neither run nor load a program, and
//     no option or value holds a control character. -F, -I, and mosh's
//     --ssh, --client and --server are refused for the same reason.
//   - A line with an option that is not a session (-G, -V, -Q, -O) is not
//     followed, and neither is a line with an option this file does not know.
//   - The client must have been started by the pane's shell, through shells
//     and known wrappers only. ssh run by scp, rsync, git or sftp is a
//     transfer, not a login, and is not followed.
//   - Only a process owned by the user the daemon runs as is read.
//
// What is kept and what is dropped from a line that is followed:
//
//   - The destination and the options that say how to reach it are kept: the
//     port, the identity, the jump host, the login name, the -o options.
//   - The remote command is dropped. The new pane is for a shell.
//   - Options that make the client something other than an interactive session
//     are dropped: -N, -f, -n, -T, -t, -s, -M, and the same things spelt as -o
//     options (RemoteCommand, SessionType, ControlMaster, and so on).
//   - Port forwards (-L, -R, -D, -W, -w) are dropped. The first client already
//     holds those ports, and a second bind fails.
//
// The argv is never given to a shell on this machine. It is exec'd as it is,
// the way every pane command is.
//
// When the remote shell reported its folder with OSC 7 and the host in the
// report is the destination's host, the new pane starts there. The remote
// login shell can be anything (csh, fish, nushell), so the command it is given
// is only `exec sh -c '...'`, and the cd runs in sh. A cd that fails (the
// folder is gone) leaves the person in their home folder rather than ending
// the connection.
