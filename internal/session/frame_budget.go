// Bounding the memory the daemon gives to what clients send.
//
// The binary protocol frames each message with a length the sender writes, up
// to maxFrameBytes. Any process that can reach a socket can send a header, so
// the daemon reads every client frame through readClientFrame, which holds
// these limits:
//
//   - The frame's type is checked before its body is read: the type's own
//     size limit (daemonFrameLimit), then the link policy and the pane grants.
//     A refused frame is skipped unread, and the stream stays in step.
//   - A body over largeFrame is charged to a read budget before any of it is
//     read: its whole announced size, frameCopies times, in one acquire that
//     takes all of it or nothing. The budget is a FIFO semaphore, so large
//     frames are read one after another and never hold part of the budget
//     while they wait for the rest. A frame that cannot get its charge within
//     readBudgetWait is skipped and refused with ErrCodeBusy.
//   - The body is read into memory that grows as its bytes arrive, never
//     allocated whole from the header. See readFramePayload.
//   - The body must arrive within frameBodyDeadline, so a sender that stalls
//     cannot hold its charge.
//
// There are two budgets (readBudgetFor). The person's clients draw on one,
// and so does the person working through a hub. Other links, hosted pane
// calls and panes without the admin grant draw on the other, so no peer and no pane can spend the budget the person's own paste
// needs. The JSON verb line reader (verb_lines.go) charges the same budgets.
//
// The charge is given back when the message has been handled, or for
// MsgInput as soon as it is read: a paste into a pane that does not read its
// input blocks in the write to the pane, and must not hold the budget there.
// A verb line gives its charge back once its envelope is decoded, for the
// same reason (verb_lines.go). What such a write holds is bounded per pane
// instead: one large input may wait on each pane, from the client or from
// any verb that types (PTY.Write). The next waits for it, and is refused as
// busy once the write holding the pane has waited paneWriteWait, so the pane
// is not reading. So the memory blocked writes hold is at most maxFrameBytes
// for each pane, plus the writes waiting for their turn, each until the pane
// has not read for paneWriteWait.
// That is accepted: only a caller that may already write to the pane can
// cause it.
//
// And the daemon serves at most maxConnections connections on its socket and
// maxLinkConnections on its link sockets. See admitConnection.
