// Window lifecycle events are derived, in one place, from the difference between
// two canonical SessionState snapshots. This matters because a mutation reaches
// daemon-owned state by one of two routes: the headless daemon-side ops in
// session_ops.go mutate the state in place, and an attached TUI performs the
// mutation itself and pushes the result back with UpdateState. Both routes funnel
// through the helpers below, so a subscriber sees the same events, with the same
// payloads and the same ordering, no matter which one ran. Emitting from the
// diff (rather than from each op and again from the TUI bridge) is also what
// makes the events exactly-once: state converges once, so it is diffed once.
//
// Events that hang off a PTY rather than off window state (output, bell,
// mode-changed, window-exit, and OSC-driven title changes) are emitted by the
// per-PTY emitter in session.go and are deliberately not derived here, so they
// are not double-counted.

// lifecycleWindow is the subset of a WindowState that window lifecycle events
// are derived from. Geometry, z-order, and alt-screen state are excluded: they
// change on nearly every render and raise no lifecycle event.
