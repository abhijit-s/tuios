// A popup the caller waits on.
//
// popup with wait keeps the call open until the popup's command exits and
// returns its exit status, so a script can use a popup the way it uses a
// command: run a picker, get the answer. capture_stdout sends the command's
// standard output to a pipe the daemon owns instead of the pane, and returns
// it. A picker such as fzf or gum draws on the terminal and prints only the
// choice to stdout, so the choice comes back and the drawing stays on the
// screen.
//
// Nothing here grants anything new. The caller picked the command, the popup
// runs it with the caller's rights, and what comes back is what that command
// printed. The pipe is the daemon's: it is handed to the popup's process
// alone and read only by the call that asked for it.

// bound is there for the command that prints a file.
