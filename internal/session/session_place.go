// With six sessions open the rail read "session-0" to "session-5", which tells
// a person nothing. The daemon already hears where every pane's shell is: fish
// and a growing number of prompts report the directory over OSC 7 on every cd,
// and the spawn directory is known before the shell prints a prompt. This file
// turns that into two facts per pane, the directory and the git branch it is
// in, and Info publishes the focused pane's pair so the rail can label an
// unnamed session by where it is.
//
// Both facts are recorded on the cwd change and at no other time. There is no
// timer and nothing here runs on a frame: a rail that re-read git state on
// every tick is exactly the idle cost this project measures and refuses. The
// branch read walks up from the directory looking for .git and reads HEAD, off
// the emulator goroutine, because a directory on a slow network mount would
// otherwise stall every byte the pane prints.
