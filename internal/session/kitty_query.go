// kittyFileMediumRefusal is the answer to a guest asking whether it may send a
// kitty image as a path (t=f, t=t or t=s) when that path would be read on a
// machine other than the one it names a file on.
const kittyFileMediumRefusal = "ENOTSUPPORTED:the path would be read on another machine"

// kittyQueryResponse is the daemon's answer to a guest's a=q graphics query,
// or nil when the guest asked not to be answered.
//
// The daemon answers queries itself, because an answer that has to go out to
// a client and back is late enough that a probing guest gives up first. That
// leaves it answering for clients it cannot ask, so it answers from what the
// clients told it when they attached, and from where a path the guest sends
// will be read.
//
// A query is not answered at all while no attached client's terminal draws
// kitty graphics (see SetKittyAdvertised): such a client drops the image, and
// silence is what a terminal without kitty graphics gives, so a guest that
// probes the way kitty documents (a query, then DA1) falls back to text or
// sixel. The rule is the one DA1 follows for sixel: any attached client that
// shows the image is enough, and with no client attached the last answer
// stands. A standalone tuios on such a terminal is silent too.
//
// Otherwise direct transmission (t=d) always works. The bytes are in the
// stream, and every client that draws the pane receives them.
//
// A file medium names something on the machine the guest runs on, and the
// client that draws the pane reads it there, or hands the path to its host
// terminal, which reads it on the client's machine. That is the same machine
// only when both the pane and every client drawing it are on this one. So a
// file medium is refused, and the guest falls back to direct transmission,
// when either is not:
//
//   - remotePane: the pane's process runs on another machine over a link, so
//     the path it sends names a file over there.
//   - a client attached over a link (see Session.SetLinkedViewer) is drawing
//     the session from another machine, where the path names nothing, or
//     names some other file.
//
// kitten icat is the guest this is written for. It probes direct, temporary
// file and shared memory transmission at once and uses the best medium that
// comes back OK, so an honest refusal costs it nothing but a copy through the
// stream, while an OK that cannot be honoured draws nothing at all.
//
// Quiet is honoured as kitty honours it: q=1 suppresses an OK and still sends
// an error, q=2 suppresses both.
