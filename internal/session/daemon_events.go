// This file implements the daemon's event hub: the fan-out that backs the
// subscribe verb's long-lived event stream and the wait-for verb's blocking
// waits. Event sources (PTY output/bell/mode changes, window and session
// lifecycle) publish typed events to the hub, which stamps each with a
// daemon-global monotonic sequence number and delivers it to every matching
// subscriber. Subscribers have a bounded queue: a slow subscriber's events are
// dropped and a gap marker is delivered rather than blocking the daemon (the
// same slow-client discipline used by daemon_stream.go for raw PTY output).
//
// The hub also keeps the most recent events in a bounded ring, so a subscriber
// that reconnects can ask for everything after the last seq it saw. Each daemon
// start picks a random boot id that is stamped on every event: a seq is only
// meaningful next to the boot id it came with, because a restarted daemon
// numbers from 1 again.

// Event type discriminators carried in a stream event's "type" field. These are
// part of the public protocol surface; keep the string values stable.
