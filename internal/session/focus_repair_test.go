// The focus-repair rule is what decides where focus lands after the focused
// window goes away. Two implementations answer that question today: the daemon's
// (CloseDaemonWindow) and the TUI's (OS.FocusNextVisibleWindow, which takes the
// first window in slice order on the current workspace that is neither minimized
// nor minimizing, and gives up with no focus when there is none).
//
// Converging close onto the daemon makes the daemon's rule the only rule, so it
// has to be the TUI's rule. This test states that rule case by case so a later
// change to it is a deliberate, visible edit rather than a silent shift in where
// the cursor ends up.
