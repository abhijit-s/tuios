// out together in one frame.
//
// Without the gate a flood went out one frame per PTY read. The stream
// goroutine drains faster than the reader fills, so the batch loop below
// rarely found more than one chunk queued, and on macOS a PTY read is about
// 330 bytes. That was about 2,900 frames per MiB, each one a daemon write, a
// client read and a handful of goroutine wakeups, for a client that draws at
// most once every 8 ms anyway. Output below streamFloodBytes per interval is
// never held, so a keystroke echo into a quiet pane goes out at once.
