// Two clients reshaping one BSP tree at the same moment.
//
// The tree is sent to the daemon as an op (see layout_tree_sync.go and
// layout_tree.go in the session package). These tests hold two full clients on
// one session, make both of them change the tree before either has heard of the
// other's change, and then let every message through. The pair has to end on
// one tree, the tree a client attaching afterwards is handed has to be that
// same tree, and nothing may still be moving once it has settled.
//
// NEGATIVE CONTROL: measured on main, where the trees ride in the push and the
// later push wins. TestTwoClientsReshapeOneTreeAtOnce failed 6 runs in 10
// there, each time with the pair split for good, for example
//
//	local split2@0.48(d6ef0c95,3165730c)
//	peer  split1@0.51(d6ef0c95,3165730c)
//
// Each client's push reached the other, each dropped the other's as older
// than its own push, and neither ever sent again. The two tests after it pass
// on main too; they pin the new-pane race, which the op has to keep working.
//
// NEGATIVE CONTROL: TestResizeWhilePeerAddsPaneKeepsTheResize failed 11 runs
// in 60 with the daemon taking a placed tree whatever it was built on
// (LayoutTreePayload.BaseVersion ignored). The peer placed the new pane on the
// tree from before the resize, and when its op landed last the split went back
// to 0.500. With the stale placement refused it passed 60 in 60.
