// and neither do the runes that are not ESC sequences but steer a terminal all
// the same: a right-to-left override, the one-byte CSI and a zero-width space.
// The rail's screen cannot show either fault: the compositor's string-to-cell
// parse keeps only SGR and OSC 8 today, so the sequences never reach it, and
// the runes reach it as cells nobody can see. So the boundary is checked on
// what dockLines returns.
