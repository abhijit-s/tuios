// A session's colour tells two sessions apart, so it is spent only where more
// than one of them is on screen at once: the rail's sessions section, the
// rail's agents section (which lists panes across every session), the session
// switcher, and the collapsed strip. The content area and the rail's terminals
// section show one session's panes and nothing else, so a colour per row there
// would distinguish them from nothing and is left off.
//
// The focus marks are the exception, and they are about coherence rather than
// information: the rail is one object, so the bar on the focused pane is the
// same hue as the bar on the session two rows above it. A single mark taking a
// colour the rail is already showing adds no vocabulary; two marks contradicting
// each other is what read as a defect.
//
// The colour comes from the session's name, which is its identity everywhere
// else too. That makes it stable across a daemon restart, identical on every
// attached client with nothing stored and no round trip to agree on, and
// unchanged by a display-name rename. The price is collisions: ten hues means
// two sessions can still land on the same one. set-session-accent is the way out and
// always wins, which is what makes the collision an annoyance rather than a
// defect.

// The ten chromatic ANSI slots a session colour is drawn from, as legacy accent
// indices (0-7 are ANSI 8-15, 8-14 are ANSI 1-7). Bright black and bright white
// are skipped: a session is identified by hue, and the two achromatic slots are
// the rail's own ink and its background. The six bright chromatic slots come
// first, each followed by its normal-ANSI twin where one exists; normal yellow
// is olive on the rail's ground and normal cyan sits too close to normal blue,
// so those two twins are left out and the two brights without a twin close the
