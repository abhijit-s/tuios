// A BSP tree is built by a client and needed by every client on the session:
// it is what the dividers between shared-border panes are read from, and it is
// what the next retile lays the panes out from. The daemon never builds one; a
// client sends it as an op and the daemon applies it (layout_tree_sync.go).
//
// This test holds two full clients on one session and watches what one
// client's tree does to the other's.
//
// NEGATIVE CONTROL: the unsentTree check cut from adoptSessionTrees, so a
// change this client has not sent yet no longer outranks a state from the
// daemon: TestAPeerKeepsItsOwnTreeAgainstADaemonEcho fails saying a
// same-version echo from the daemon replaced the stacked tree with the
// side-by-side one. Against a daemon too old for ops the adoptTopology gate
// in ApplyStateSyncFrom does the same job.

// treeShape renders a client's tree for the current workspace with the panes
// named by their PTYs rather than by int IDs, so two clients' trees can be
// compared whatever numbers each handed out.

// is tempting to read that as the scheme needing no code of its own, and this
// test asserted exactly that while calling SyncStateToDaemon by hand to make it
// pass -- proving the mechanism rather than the behaviour. Nothing obliges a
