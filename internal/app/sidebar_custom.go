// The rail's custom section: the rows a command of the user's printed.
//
// The command is a dock component in everything but where it draws. It is
// scheduled by the dock engine, with the dock's refresh grammar, debounce,
// sanitiser, timeout and failure rule, because a second scheduler for the
// same kind of subprocess would be a second set of ways for it to go wrong.
// Three things differ. Two are flags on the component: every line is a row
// (MultiLine), and an event that lands mid-run keeps one re-run (Coalesce).
// The third is the run's environment, which carries the focused pane and
// the section's size. The model hands those to the engine under its lock,
// because runs start on the engine's goroutines and may not read the model.

// railCustomComponent is the engine name of the section's command. It is not
// under the dock's custom/ prefix, so it is never drawn as a bar cell, and
// tuios refresh-dock rail/custom reaches it.
