// The BSP trees as ops. See layout_tree.go in the session package for the
// daemon's half.
//
// This client changes its own trees at once, wherever it changes them, so a
// drag or a split never waits for the daemon. What it tells the daemon is
// worked out at the one place it speaks, SyncStateToDaemon: every workspace
// whose tree is not the tree the session was last known to hold goes out as an
// op. treeSeen is that record, one key per workspace (see session.TreeKey).
//
// The same record decides what a state from the daemon may do to a tree. A
// tree that differs from treeSeen is a change this client has made and not yet
// sent, and nothing the daemon sends can be newer than it, so it stays. Any
// other tree is replaced by the session's. A state built before this client's
// own ops landed never gets that far: the ops are counted as pushes, and
// AcceptState drops a state that predates one.
//
// One kind of change is neither sent nor kept: a tree this client reworked
// while applying a state, because the session's tree did not fit what it
// holds (a pane the session's tree has not heard of yet, say). That is a local
// display decision, the same thing applyingPeerSync keeps out of the push, and
// sending it is how two clients that disagree end up arguing. treeDerived
// records it, so it is shown here, not sent, and the session's next tree
// replaces it. Two exceptions: the answer a sync owes (a pane this client
// placed), which SyncStateToDaemon sends with the trees it touched, and a tree
// for a workspace the session holds none for, where there is nothing to argue
// with.
//
// The panes are laid out from the tree this client holds, never from another
// client's rectangles. See bspRectsOffTree.

// treeOpsOn reports whether this client sends its trees as ops. Against a
// daemon that predates them it sends them in its pushes, as before.
