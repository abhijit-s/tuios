// The frame's cell buffer and the layers composed onto it.
//
// This used to be lipgloss's Canvas and Compositor, and the profile of a
// keystroke frame put more than half of the compose in the two of them doing
// work the frame did not need. The Compositor measured every layer's content
// twice per frame, once when the layer was added to its root and once when it
// flattened the tree, and a grapheme-width pass over a pane's whole body is
// not cheap. It then re-parsed every layer's string into cells on every frame,
// including the panes whose layer had not changed since the last one, which
// is most of them. And the Canvas underneath was a RenderBuffer, so every cell
// written paid a damage comparison and a touched-line update for a buffer
// that is cleared and rebuilt from scratch each frame anyway.
//
// What replaces them keeps the observable output byte for byte and drops the
// rest. frameCanvas is a plain uv.Buffer. composeLayersIn orders the layers the
// way the Compositor did and draws each one either straight from its string,
// as before, or from a cellLayer: the cells that string parsed to the last
// time it was seen. A pane's layer keeps its string between keystrokes in
// other panes, so its cells are parsed once per rebuild and copied thereafter.

// frameCanvas is the composed frame as cells. It stands in for the
// lipgloss.Canvas GetCanvas used to return and offers the same surface:
// CellAt hands back a pointer into the buffer, so the spotlight pass and the
// tests that inspect a cell keep working unchanged.
