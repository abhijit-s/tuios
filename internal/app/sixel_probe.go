// An SSH client's terminal cannot be probed before the session starts: the
// program owns the channel's input from the first byte, and the server only
// has the TERM and environment the client sent, which is where the passive
// guess in internal/server/ssh_caps.go comes from. TERM=xterm-256color is sent
// by terminals with sixel and by many more without it, so the guess is weak.
//
// Once the program runs, its own input reader can take the answer. The client
// is asked for DA1, the same question the local startup probe asks, and the
// reply decides sixel for this session. A local terminal was probed before the
// program started and a browser is known to draw sixel, so only SSH asks.
//
// A local terminal can answer the startup probe too late: the probe gives up
// after probeTimeout, and the reply reaches the program's input reader
// instead. Dropped, it left a terminal with sixel taken for one without, so
// its images were drawn as glyphs. The probe records that it gave up
// (HostCapabilities.DA1Late), and the first reply after that is taken here.

// sixelProbe asks an SSH client's terminal who it is and for its device
// attributes. XTVERSION goes first, so a terminal that stores images in its
// cells is known before its DA1 could turn sixel on (handleHostVersion).
