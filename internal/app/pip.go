// The picture-in-picture view: a small live copy of one pane, drawn in a
// corner of the screen while another pane has the focus, so a person working
// in one pane can watch another (typically a coding agent) without giving it
// room in the layout.
//
// The view is not a pane. The source pane stays where it is in the layout, or
// keeps running where it is when it sits on another workspace, is minimised
// or is a hidden scratch terminal. The view only reads the cells that pane's
// emulator already holds; there is no second emulator and no second stream.
// It never takes the focus or a key. A click on it jumps to the source pane,
// and the view is not drawn while the source pane has the focus, because the
// pane itself is then on the screen.
//
// It is this client's, like the spotlight. Nothing about it is in session
// state, so each attached client pins its own pane (or none), and a detach
// forgets it. One view per client: a second pin replaces the first. More than
// one would need a stacking rule for the corners and the cursor avoidance
// below, and nobody has asked for it yet.
//
// What it costs. The view's body is read from the emulator only when the
// source pane had output since the last read (MarkTerminalsWithNewContent
// sets pip.dirty), and the finished box is a layer with an id, so on any
// other frame the compositor copies cells it already parsed. It adds no tick
// and no timer, so an idle session stays idle. It does take the fullscreen
// fast path away while it is drawn, because that path composes no layers.
//
// It never covers the focused pane's cursor, nor the text to the cursor's left
// on its row, which is the line being typed. The box stays in its corner until
// that line reaches it, then moves to the first other corner clear of it. It
// stays there until the line reaches it again, rather than going back, so a
// cursor that moves about near an edge does not make the box jump to and fro.
