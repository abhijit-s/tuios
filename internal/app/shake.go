// A shake of the pointer turns the spotlight on and off, the way shaking a
// mouse on macOS finds the cursor. It is off until a person asks for it, and
// it goes through ToggleSpotlight, so the key, the palette, the settings row
// and the gesture all move the same state and all persist it.
//
// The whole feature is a few comparisons on an event that has already arrived,
// so it costs nothing to have. What it can cost is a screen that goes dark for
// a reason nobody typed, and that is what every number below is chosen for.
//
// Where it runs. In Update's mouse-motion case, not in the motion handler.
// Motion is routed away from handleMouseMotion whenever capture mode or the
// scrollback browser is up, and handleMouseMotion itself returns early for a
// context menu, a rail drag, a workspace pill drag and an overlay drag. Update
// sees every motion event exactly once, before any of that.
//
// What it adds to an idle client. Nothing. There is no timer, no tick and no
// term in tickNeedsWork: arriving motion is the whole clock, the state is a
// fixed-size struct that allocates nothing, and a client whose pointer is at
// rest never reaches any of it. BenchmarkIdleTick is unmoved.
//
// What it will not do while a button is down. See noteShakeMotion.

	// It is the whole defence against jitter. A hand resting on a mouse moves
	// the pointer one or two columns, and pointer acceleration on a high-DPI
	// device turns a small physical tremor into a larger one, so a detector
	// that counted every sign change on dx would fire on somebody breathing.
	// Eight columns is far past any of that and is a small fraction of a
	// deliberate stroke, which crosses a good part of the screen.

	// Four is two complete there-and-back cycles. macOS asks for about three to
	// find a cursor; this asks for one more, because showing a cursor is a
	// thing a person can ignore and darkening most of the screen is not. It is
	// also what rules out the ordinary sweep: crossing the screen and coming
	// back is one reversal, and correcting an overshoot is one more.

	// shakeMaxReversalGap is how long one turn may take after the last one.

	// This is the part that means "fast", and it is what a total time window
	// alone would miss. A person shakes at three to five turns a second, so a
	// real gesture has no pause in it at all. Two ordinary moves that each
	// overshoot and correct give four reversals as well, but they have a dwell
	// between them where the hand picks the next target. A gap bound rejects
	// those and a window of the same total length does not.

	// 750 ms.

	// already fired may fire again.

	// A hand does not stop on the reversal that crosses the threshold. Without
	// this the rest of the same shake counts four more turns and puts the beam
	// back where it started, which reads as the gesture not working. Resting is

// A button is held. This is the one suppression that matters, and it is what
// makes the gesture safe to have on. Every way a person moves a pointer fast
// and far while working is a drag: sizing a pane by its divider, moving a
// window by its title bar, selecting text in a pane, dragging a rail row, a
// workspace pill, a slider. All of them are somebody working, and a beam that
// went on and off in the middle of one would be worse than no gesture. Held is
// read off the motion event rather than a flag, for the reason update.go reads
// pointerDown the same way: motion names the buttons still down, so it is the
// most current answer and it corrects a press or a release whose own event
// never arrived. The gesture in progress is forgotten on the way in and on the
// way out, so a drag can neither finish a shake that started before it nor
// start one that finishes after.
