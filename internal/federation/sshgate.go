// Tailscale SSH can stand between ssh and the machine. Two of the things it
// does there reach tuios only as text on ssh's stderr, and both used to be
// reported as a generic failure.
//
// In "check" mode Tailscale holds the connection open until the person
// approves the login in a browser. Before it waits, it prints two lines as the
// ssh banner, and ssh writes them to stderr even with BatchMode on:
//
//	# Tailscale SSH requires an additional check.
//	# To authenticate, visit: https://login.tailscale.com/a/l1d9c7e392d3020
//
// Then nothing more arrives. ssh's ConnectTimeout does not end the wait, since
// the TCP connection and the key exchange are done, so a link waits until its
// own deadline and reports "did not answer in time". When the person approves,
// Tailscale prints "# Authentication checked with Tailscale SSH." and the
// session goes on. Every new connection gets a new link, so a command that
// gives up and tries again asks for a new approval.
//
// A policy that refuses the login ends the connection at once with a line
// that names the user: "tailnet policy does not permit you to SSH as user
// "root"". That is a wrong user in the address more often than not.
//
// All of this text comes from the far side, so it is read as data: the URL
// must look like one, and nothing else of it is repeated.
