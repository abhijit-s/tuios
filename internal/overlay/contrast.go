// the small type is: the dock's labels are one row tall and read at a glance.

// StructureTarget is what decorative structure aims at: an edge rule, a

// above, and the rule the three of them state together is that chrome goes

// separator from the 3:1 non-text floor, and a separator is the one piece of
// chrome that carries no meaning of its own: take the rule away and the layout
// still reads off alignment and whitespace. Nothing that is text or a mark is
// allowed down here.
//
// A target rather than a floor, because structure fails by being loud at least
// as often as by being faint. Drawn in the same ink as the labels it frames, a
// rail's edge plus a dock's separator is more cells than every label in the

// quiet at both ends. The quietest an ink can be against black and white at the
// same time is 4.58:1, louder than the labels a rule is meant to sit under, so
// a fixed choice buys its quiet on one ground by drawing a hard line on the
